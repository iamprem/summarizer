R12EOMVKIB1RQE	5.0	This is basically a regular tablet but..	352	368	When I ordered this I was expecting something like a cheap piece of plastic that played games for the kids. I was not expecting something like this at all. The reason I say this is because of the price and I have had kid tablets before ...HAD... is the keyword , that were around the same price. So I was very happy to know that it was way more than that. It's 7" from the top corner to the bottom right corner . It has a headphone jack to plug in headphones, it has a front and back camera that is located right in the middle when you have the tablet turned sideways. It comes with the power cord, and a USB plug that plugs into the tablet and either a computer or something. It also comes with the instruction manual that has everything you could possibly want to know about it. It even has a micro SD slot built into it to allow more space for games or pictures. The picture is really clear and the screen is easy to tap and navigate to different things without pressing hard at all. Has the touch of an iPad. Now it also comes with a nice big gel case that protects your tablet so well. You just slip it on and you are good to go. Protects the screen very well and it's like the tablet is now covered in a big safe bubble. It comes with pre-installed apps for the kids already to play so that's always a plus and you could always download what ever you want from the Google app store too of course. The thing that makes this so kid proof I would have to say, is the parent control app. What that does is, it allows you to monitor what your kids see, controls how long the kids can use the tablet for,can prevent them from downloading certain things and everything. So you do not have to worry about them looking at anything obscene and can have piece of mind while they are having fun. Despite the case thou and the parent control app, this is pretty much a regular well designed tablet for anybody. I really suggest this to any parent for their little ones, it's well worth it. I was happy to be able to receive this as a free sample to give my honest review on it to everyone and I am very pleased with it and recommend it. If you would like to know anything, please just comment below and I will answer any questions you have right away. Also if my review helped you in anyway please don't be a stranger to the "Helpful" button(:
R1U1WKEDXJBDO9	4.0	It's no Nexus 7...BUT it's also much less expensive	163	171	 Please note: I received a free sample for evaluation and review. I apologize in advance for the length of the video that is almost 10 minutes long, and I'll summarize the highlights of my impressions below to save you some time. The video shows off the hardware (with the blue case, but it's the same otherwise) and software and will hopefully help you in your shopping if you're seriously considering buying this. Here's my bottom line - you don't pay much, and you get what you pay for. Take that how you want. :) It's a $60 tablet after all. I think that it's actually pretty good for the money, especially for young kids, but I want to help manage your expectations. Don't order this thinking that you're saving money because it's not a well-known brand name. You're saving money because it's a nicely designed tablet filled with lower end hardware. And you know what? That might be exactly what you want. I don't have kids, but I have a buddy who's kids (well, one in particular) consistently destroys electronics. I mean - destroys. Mostly the screens. MacBook Airs, iPhones, iPads...none survive. So, if your kids are like that, something like this might be a great choice. Well, or a box of crayons and blank paper. :D Sometimes, you should go old school. However, if you want to get your little wrecking ball a tablet, why not save some money in the process? Alright, here are the pluses that I've noticed: (*) Nice form factor and good feel to it - not too heavy, and not too light. It's like the Goldilocks of sizes for kids (*) GREAT cover, IMO. I love that thing. Comfortable, easy to grip, likely provides some protection (but I haven't hurled this at my brother...who also wrote a review, btw). Seriously - it's one nice cover (*) Comes with Android KitKat, and you can install any Android apps that you want (*) It comes with a "Kid Mode" for your kids that will lock them out of the normal functions, even if they try to reboot it (*) Decent speaker. Not great, but not too bad with the volume turned all of the way up...otherwise, it's pretty quiet (*) Despite no mention of it in the instruction, you can charge it via micro USB. I don't know why they even included a power adapter that most people will misplace. Just use one of the (I'm guessing) many cables that you already have for your phones/tablets to charge this up (*) It can help relieve your stress if your kid cracks the screen or throws it into a river, as compared to something more expensive (*) It might help your kids appreciate the more expensive tablets Some not-so-awesome aspects, which might not surprise you at this price point: (*) Off-axis viewing in one of the directions is atrocious. I'm not kidding. One might say that if a blind person was granted the gift of sight for the first time and opened their eyes to see this screen at an angle...it might be the most beautiful thing that they ever saw. Maybe. Darkness is close competition (*) Speed. Quad core or not, this certainly isn't the snappiest of tablets. That said, it's not horribly slow...but consider how patient your kids are (*) Whoever applied the included screen protector was either related to the owner of the factory or just generally didn't care at all. At all. Both my brother and I had pretty noticeable issues with those protectors. Mine had several dust particles (which cause bubbles) underneath. I just took it off...which brings me to the next point (*) The plastic (I'm pretty sure it's plastic) screen doesn't allow fingers to slide very well without that screen protector. So, if yours shows up as bad as mine, plan on buying another screen protector to put on it. Well, unless your kid destroys it first. :D (*) Battery life. Eeeee. Not a problem if your kid has ADD, but it's not going to last for hours like an iPad. I haven't pushed it to the limit, but it dropped over 10% in the time it took me to record the video. I had to charge it before the video because I had it in standby for about a day and it was totally out of juice. You probably want to grab a battery pack if you're taking a car trip or something (*) The cameras blow. Sure, they would seem like magic from someone from the 1500's. Okay, from the 1960's, even. Nowadays, though, they are below what I'd expect So, do I think it's worth it? That totally depends on what you want out of it. It's a decent tablet with some really basic software installed for your kids, but it's Android, so you can install any number of apps. If you want something cheap for your kids to play with - game on. If you're hoping to score a super tablet because it's an off-name brand...nope. It won't compete toe-to-toe with a higher-end tablet, but it's a LOT cheaper. A lot. That's the draw, and if that is attractive to you, then this could be a good option. I give it four stars because it's actually pretty cool for the price. If they were charging $100+, I'd bash them all day long. At $60 (currently), it's actually pretty good. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave me a comment and I'll respond as soon as I can. Thanks!
R192D3R883PEO	5.0	Incredible value! Dual cameras and impressive sound quality! Great silicone case included. Best budget tablet deal out there!	131	145	My kids have had Nexus 7 tablets for over 3 years, and they seem to be nearing the end of their electronic lifespan, so when I saw this inexpensive Android tablet designed for kids, I was quite intrigued and eager to take a closer look. First of all, I should say that at this $60 pricepoint, this is an excellent product and truly has exceeded my expectations. When the price is this low, a user should not expect a top quality "retina level" display or ultra-fast processing speed. That is not what this is tablet is designed to do. What it is designed for is to be a basic Android tablet, and for that I am quite impressed. I have seen other reviewers suggesting that in order to make this tablet useable at all, it needs to have a factory reset and to disable lots of applications. I am quite tech savvy and know how to do all that (having done it on multiple smartphones in the past), but honestly I don't see the need here with the Dragon Touch tablet by TabletExpress. It is running quite stably just as it came - I am finding the processing speed and ability to install and use apps to be absolutely fine. When I first opened this up and started it up, it was quite straightforward to set up, much like any other Android device I have used. I was able to hook up the Dragon Touch to my home wifi network and sync it with my standard Google profile. Note that if you are planning to use this for kids (especially young ones), I highly recommend either using an alternate Google profile or if (like me) you want to use your main profile since it has all the apps you've purchased, turn off the sync with Gmail and disable Google+ if you prefer that your kids not get into your e-mail or access social media! I also recommend installing something like Perfect AppLock (available for free if you don't mind banner ads) to password protect any other apps you might prefer that they not access (for example the Google Play Store itself, Chrome, YouTube, and the Android Settings app). The touchscreen on the Dragon Touch works quite well. I am finding it to be very touch responsive for a variety of apps, although the viewing angles are not the greatest. To get decent color fidelity, it really needs to be viewed straight on, and even then there are sometimes faint lines on the screen. The physical feel of it is decent, although not as smooth to the touch as the glass on our Nexus 7. I'm not sure exactly what some other reviewers are complaining about with an ill-fitting screen protector. When I took mine out of the box, there was a plastic film, clearly meant to be protective during shipping. Perhaps there was a portion of this that could be kept on to provide protection during use, I removed the full film and it works just fine. The silicone case on this is really excellent. It fits on nicely and gives full access to all the ports and speakers, while making the tablet more resistant to drops and bumps and also making it softer and more comfortable to hold. I really like that the case is included with the tablet - no need to find and pay for a separate case. I have the green one, which is a great lime green color that also makes the tablet easy to spot if someone happens to leave it somewhere unusual. They also make a number of other kid-friendly colors. The tablet itself is quite lightweight, which is also a good plus for use with kids. The features on this tablet are really impressive, especially for only $60. I really like that this has BOTH front and rear facing cameras. Our Nexus 7 (for a lot more $$) only has the front facing. The photo quality is decent - they do not show the camera resolutions in the product info, but the front facing one does seem to be higher resolution than the rear facing. The audio speakers are much higher quality than I was expecting. I turned the volume all the way up and opened up the music app and was really amazed at how good the music sounded. Now I'm not claiming that it is professional quality sound, but I've seen expensive laptops with worse quality music from the built in speakers! I really like that it has the latest version of Android (KitKat 4.4) all ready to use. I've run a number of different types of apps and they all seem to behave as expected. As I said before the touch screen is nicely responsive. The tilt sensors also work well, as I could tell from some different games, including labyrinth style mazes, which rely on very sensitive tilt controls. I've also tested this out for some more mom-friendly apps. I happen to run a number of apps on my phone that are designed to earn points towards redeeming for gift cards. The Dragon Touch performs really well with Perk TV and Perk Live (the latter of which can be quite finicky as to which devices it "likes" to work with!). I also like using it to rack up points on Swagbucks. In fact at this price point I would recommend this if an adult is just looking for an extra tablet to use for apps like these or other casual use. I may end up keeping this for myself after all, if I can keep my two young kids away from it! For everyday use in situations where wifi is available, this is a great budget tablet. I will mention that it was a bit confusing to me at first finding and using the power and volume up/down buttons, since they are located differently from every other Android tablet or phone that I have used. This is really not a big deal, just something to get used to. It comes with a separate AC adapter, but also can be charged with any standard micro USB cord, plugged either into my computer or a USB AC adapter. I'm very glad that I was able to receive this as a sample in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.
R32CE96DTRNW5O	4.0	Unusable out of the box, nice tablet once fixed; please read for EXTENSIVE caveats and instructions	85	96	Update: I've added a video. The photos below are one of the tablet itself and two taken by the tablet (one per camera) to show how... wonderful... the photos are. *** PLEASE NOTE THAT THE VIDEO REVIEW IS *AFTER* I DID THE MODIFICATIONS DESCRIBED BELOW - IT DOES *NOT* WORK LIKE THAT OUT OF THE BOX *** *** PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT YOU *NEED* TO INVEST ABOUT HALF AN HOUR IN SETTING THIS UP PROPERLY; IT IS USELESS OUT OF THE BOX (SEE BELOW) *** I want to say right off the bat that I received a free sample for evaluation. As a result of that, though, I did some things with this that I might have been afraid to do had I bought it, so allow me to be your guinea pig. You'll note that I gave it four stars. I believe it deserves those stars, but not out of the box. You'll need to tinker a bit. I'll tell you what issues I had with it as-sold, and how I fixed them, and as a result why I think it's a four-star purchase, given the price. Note the "given the price" bit, because otherwise, you should buy the FireHD Kids Edition Tablet. Of course, it's *three times as expensive* (give or take, depending on screen size and such). My co-worker has one for his son, I've played with it, and it is noticeably better than this tablet in every category... unless you absolutely must have Play Store access (which is a nice thing, don't get me wrong, and which the Kindles don't have). But, again, it's *much* more expensive, and you'll likely looking at this because you don't have $150+ sitting around to spend on a tablet for your young child/grandchild/favored pet. So let's see how this can work for you. Truly, it can. You'll just need to do a few things. First, let's tear it down before we build it back up, shall we? There are some problems with this, and you can't fix all of them. Trust me, though, in the end, we'll see the (four) stars shine. But there's a storm to deal with before then. *** Please understand that I do think this is a good tablet, once "fixed", but there are a lot of initial issues, and you should be aware of them. I apologize for the length of text below, but I think it's important. *** * Issue #1: THE INCLUDED CHILDREN'S SOFTWARE IS ATROCIOUS. I cannot even adequately describe how bad it is, but I'll try. *THIS IS THE REASON YOU BOUGHT THIS TABLET* and it is horrifically, unusably, unforgivably bad. It's called Zoodles. You should not use it. First, after turning on WiFi (because - see below - it doesn't come enabled), you will go to the Applications Viewer (the icon to touch looks like two rows of three dots each in a circle on the middle of the bottom of the screen) and open the Parent Dashboard app. How did you know to do so? Answer: you didn't. Anyway, it'll ask for your birth year. Guess what? This is the PIN to keep kids from using other apps, and when you need to enter it in any of the Zoodles apps, it asks you specifically for "your birth year", not "your PIN", so if your kid knows when you were born, the jig is up. Of course, you can enter a random PIN anyway, but it doesn't tell you the birth year will be used as a PIN or that it'll be referred to as your birth year. Also, your PIN has to be a reasonable birth year (example: 5612 didn't work). So, so, *so* bad. Next, it'll ask for an email. Use a dummy one (see below). Then, it'll try to sell you on the $5/month premium package, which isn't included, obviously. Without it, there's not a lot you can do to restrict how your child uses the tablet. Then it'll tell you you need to install Flash Player. Flash Player was a useful thing, and the Internet would have died without it, perhaps, but it's no longer part of Android, and these games won't run unless you download a version of Flash Player. It'll tell you that, and it'll tell you to go into Settings->Security and enable the "Unknown Sources" check box, which will warn you not to do that, but the instructions tell you to check it anyway. If you know what you're doing, that's fine, but it's a terrible thing to tell people to do in general. Anyway... while I didn't spend *too* long on it, it didn't work for me, even following the steps, and I'm quite tech savvy. Maybe I missed a step. The point is: this should have been included in the software shipped with this tablet if it is essential to using kid's mode - and it is. So, let's say that, like me, you couldn't get it installed. In that case, Zoodles is basically worthless. The "games"? They're all YouTube videos. Yay. The art app? Good luck drawing with it: not all the touches register, so... kids will get annoyed. There are books to read, and you can record yourself reading them in a video, but... you're using the low-quality cameras to do so, and as a result I can't recommend that. You can send mail if you set it up, supposedly, but... look, the point is, this is a train wreck. It's an abomination. It is unusable. But... see below. We can fix this. It's just unfortunate that we have to. * Issue #2: Non-standard power cable. This is borderline unacceptable - the tablet *has* a micro USB port, so you'd think it could be charged with a ubiquitous USB charger, but instead it comes with a proprietary cable that has a small, thin tip (prone to breaking, I'd think). Furthermore, the charger doesn't plug all the way it - it protrudes maybe ~1/5" (~0.5cm) from the charging port. Fortunately, the silicone bumper case hides all that and also helps protect the plug, so this is all more of an inconvenience than a deal breaker. The biggest issue with it is that you'll need to get an AC inverter (like, say, this) for your car if you want to bring this anywhere and expect it to last more than a few hours. *EXCEPT*... late-breaking news: YOU CAN CHARGE IT WITH THE MICRO USB PORT. I *just* discovered this in a "what the heck, I'll just try it" moment (again, because I didn't pay for it, so I can take the risks for you). Yes, you can charge it like any other micro USB device. It appears it takes longer, and maybe it's charging at 500mA instead of the 2A the charger provides (despite me using a 2.4A-capable micro USB charger), but I have no idea why they don't mention this. It means you can charge it like other devices and can still use it if the proprietary cable breaks. * Issue #3: The user manual. It is really, really, *really* out of date. It mentions the Android Market. That's what Google Play Store used to be called *over three years ago*. It shows screen renderings of earlier, pre-Android 4.4 (pre-Android 4.x, it seems) screens. So, yes, it's sort of useful, maybe, but not so much. You're as likely to find bad info here as good. I'd ignore it. Let me (and, of course, the Internet) be your guide. * Issue #4: The initial way it comes set up (aside from he terrible kid's software). When you turn it on, the home screen has no apps and WiFi is not enabled. If you don't know your way around Android, you're sort of out of luck here. Yes, you can look at the user manual, and, if you really look hard, you can decipher how to enable WiFi, but it's not apparent. Again, let me be your guide. * Issue #5: The cameras are identical, and *really* low quality. I've attached some photos. The ones of the box this came in were taken by the front and back cameras. Doesn't really matter which is which - they seem to take identical photos. Also, they are saved as 1600x1200 resolution images. They are *not* that good. They are *maybe* 640x480 (but muddled), blown up to fit the larger size. Small kids won't mind. Everyone else probably will. There's an option in the camera app to use the lower resolution. Do so - the larger resolution takes up more space but provides zero extra actual image precision. * Issue #6: The touch screen has a ~1/2" x ~1/2" (~1cm x ~1cm) square in the upper right corner that doesn't accept touch input. I used the built-in developer mode as well as a free app to verify this: it just doesn't register touches there. Sadly, that's where a lot of close/search/menu items are. Solution: rotate it 180° so the bottom left becomes the upper right, and it'll work for you. But you shouldn't have to do that. * Issue #7: The screen is horrible off-axis. Horrible. Dead-on, it's actually pretty good, color wise. I've attached a photo of my awesome Pacific Rim Jaeger (the Gipsy Danger... and no, it isn't "Gypsy") holding it, and you can see the colors well. Note that the moire pattern is an artifact of taking the photo - the colors are solid. But move it even a little - and I'm talking 5 degrees - and it is much, much worse. This tablet could be shared by two side-by-side kids only if they're small enough not to care that it looks the way it will to at least one of them. Speaking of screens: one of the photos shows an HDMI port. This doesn't actually have one (but it's not mentioned, either... I think it's just a photo of a different version). * Issue #8: Headphones are essentially required. Yes, it has a speaker, and yes, you can hear it, but in any real-world environment, it's likely not loud enough. Maybe it is, but I can assure you this won't blow your eardrums. So maybe that's a plus. * Issue #9 Developer mode is enabled. This isn't a *huge* deal, but it's something that typically only developers use, and it can mess up your device if not used properly (example: tell it to use the ART runtime instead of Dalvik - just one little checkbox tiny fingers could find! - and it'll brick the tablet). There is no reason for this to be the case. ----------------- So... how do we fix this? Because, right now, it's looking like 1 star. A complete waste. A call to return it to Amazon. Crying children. Teeth being gnashed. Yelling. Questions of "how did my life end up here?" Let me help. I'm going to step through this from the very beginning. To do that, I'm going to factory-reset my tablet. I'll tell you how to do that, too, in case you ever need to (please note that you DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS if you just opened the tablet and likely not even if you're played with it a lot; I'm just telling you how, just in case): Factory Reset directions: * If your tablet *isn't* unusable, make sure it's on, then press and hold the power button long enough to see the Power Off/Reboot/Silent mode screen, then click Reboot and say OK (if your tablet *is* unusable, press and hold the power button until it starts to reboot, or, if it's off, just long enough to get it started powering on). IMMEDIATELY press AND HOLD *both* volume buttons until you see the Dragon Touch image show up, blink, and be replaced by a screen with the Bugdroid (little green Android guy) image in the background and some text in the foreground. THIS MIGHT TAKE 15 SECONDS OR SO. KEEP THOSE BUTTONS HELD. STAY ON TARGET. If nothing appears for 20 seconds, it probably isn't powering on, so try again. They key is to get those volume buttons down before it starts to boot, immediately after it goes to power on and before you can see anything on the screen. * Once you see Bugdroid, use the Volume Down button to scroll to "wipe data/factory reset" (you can also use Volume Up to scroll up if you go past it), then click the Power button to select it. * On the next screen, again use the Volume Down button to go to "Yes -- delete all user data" and use the Power button to select it. * When that's done (maybe 10 seconds or so), "reboot system now" will be selected - press the Power button to do so. Wait for it to reboot. Starting from the beginning (upon opening the box or after resetting... modify as appropriate if you've already used it a bit): * You'll be greeted with the initial colors-and-butterflies screen. If you powered on and walked away, you might need to unlock it - just put your finger on the lock in the circle and drag it to the "unlocked" icon. If the screen ever goes black, click the power button and do this again. * You'll then be told to make yourself at home... just click "OK". This might not happen for tablets right out of the box, but it will for factory reset tablets. * At some point now or soon, you might be asked if you want to share your location. Do as you wish. * You'll see a little gear icon on the bottom left, next to the camera icon. Click it. It takes you to Settings. Note that you can also slide a finger down onto the screen (from the very top) on the right side, and you'll see the Settings gear there, too. I mention this because that gear in the tray that you likely just clicked can be moved. * You'll see WiFi is off - it's there on the upper left. Click (or slide) it to on. You'll see available WiFi hotspots. Hopefully you'll know one of them. Click it, enter the password, and log in. Advanced users will know how to do other things, but most will click and log in. * While still in Settings - or once back there - scroll down on the left to "Apps" and click it. On the right, you'll now see the downloaded apps that came with this. For each of them: click it, then on the next screen click "Uninstall", then click OK. You don't need them. Removing them will free up space and memory. Once each is done, move to the next (it might not disappear until you've clicked the next thing). There are likely three altogether. If things seem to freeze, click something other than Apps on the left, then click back. * Next, use your finger and slide the right side over from "Downloaded" to "Running" (just drag your finger to the left). Click on Kid Mode and click Stop. Say OK when it asks. Why do this? It removes some strain from the system, since you won't be using it. * Next, slide over to "All" from "Running" (with your finger, like before). In there, for each of the following, click the app, then click "Force Stop" (if available) and "OK", then "Disable" and say OK, then click the back arrow on the bottom of the screen (2nd from the right, next to the volume-up icon). This will free up system resources BUT THEY ALL SEEM TO COME BACK ON A REBOOT. Note this, because you'll need to do this the next time you reboot, probably, to save on resources. Anyway, those unneeded apps include Browser, Email (unless you want email on this), Exchange Services, Kid Mode, Sound Recorder (unless you want that), and Zoodles Game Player. Others, maybe, but do NOT do this with any apps that show the green Android guy. * You might want to move down to Developer options, click on it, and slide the main switch to "Off" - there is no reason to have this on for 99% of the people who will buy this tablet. * Now that you're done with that, hit the Home icon (center, bottom) and get out of Settings. * Now is a good time to learn how to get applications out of memory, since you have so little. Click the Recent Apps icon (bottom, second from left, looks like one rectangle in front of another), then you'll see Settings. Touch it briefly and "flick it" up - you'll just land a finger on it and swipe up; you won't touch it for more than a brief moment. Remember how to do this, because you should frequently clear out apps in memory that you aren't using. You don't *have* to, but it'll help on this tablet to do so. * Let's clear away some apps from the dock/tray. Note: any apps you see on the home screen aren't actually the apps, they're just a link to the app. Deleting these won't delete the apps, it'll just remove the link. You can easily replace them if you change your mind. Anyway, let's say you don't need your child messing around with the File Manager - it's the thing that looks like a filing cabinet. Touch the icon and, while keeping your finger on it, drag it to the `x' that'll appear with "Remove" next to it at the top of the screen. Poof! Gone. Do that with other things you don't want your kids to use. It's not like they can't get to them via the Applications View icon (the dots in the circle), but at least it's less easy to do so. * You can open the Applications View (click that icon) and drag icons from there to the home screen(s) to place links there. You can drag them to the screens themselves, or, for a limited number of them, to the tray at the bottom. The tray stays in place when you slide between home screens. This is standard Android stuff. You can read about it elsewhere. * Now let's add some apps. Click on the Play Store icon (either on the tray or, if you removed it, in the Applications View). It'll ask you for your Google account. STRONG ADVICE: make a new one unless you're positive you want to use yours. It can be anything you want, just don't forget the account name or password. Why will you do this? Because you can set this up with NO payment info, so your kid *cannot* ring up charges no matter what. Anyway, set up the account (or sign into yours), skip the payment info (if it's a new account), and go to the Play Store. * Choose apps and download them. Netflix works. Angry Birds works. Club Penguin works. Etc. (The Disney Channel app doesn't seem to, for some reason, at least for me). Find some apps that don't need Wifi and others that do... you just need a few that don't need it so your kid can use this in the car/while out. Even if you skipped entering payment info, you can download free apps. You can also get a Google Play card and load funds that way... that would let you set a limit on what can be bought but wouldn't force your child to use only free apps. * These apps will show up on your home screen. Move them around as you wish. Again, standard Android stuff you can read about elsewhere. There are millions of apps. I am *sure* you can find a good selection for your kids (and you). You should be good to go. You can now use most Android references to decide what to do next (apps to get, how to change wallpaper, etc.). I recommend downloading Google Play Launcher instead of the default launcher, but that's your call. I also go into Settings and change things like the time until the display sleeps, etc. Again, it's all your call. If you do all this, do you lose the ability to control when and for how long your kid plays? No, not really. Just take the tablet. Or, better, just keep the charger. This won't last long without one. So... why four stars? Yes, it is set up badly - unforgivably badly - out of the box. But most of the issues are resolvable, and it's now a decent, usable, kid-friendly $60 tablet. The silicone bumper is great (note: it'll pick up dirt and stains easily, but, hey, you've got kids, so that's not unusual to you). The fact you can charge it faster with the built-in charger but also can charge via micro USB is very nice... even more so because, if one of those two ports gets broken, you can use the other to charge (pro tip: use electrical tape to block one of them so it's available if the other is jammed with peanut butter). It accepts microSD cards, so you can put movies and such on those and watch with the included UHD Player app or with others, like MX Player (or MX Player Pro, which I prefer). Battery life isn't phenomenal, but it isn't bad for this class of tablet either. Note that this isn't even remotely waterproof, so be careful around fluids. If your kid is especially spill-friendly, you might want to tape up all sorts and untape the charging one only when charging. It's up to you. So, after some work, I actually like this tablet. I have to say that, out of the box, I wasn't fond of it. Now, though, it's quite usable. It just took a little effort. But not too much. It's unfortunate it took any, though.
RXCJODA4PEA15	5.0	Great Android Tablet for Kids!	23	23	I have four children and all of them are technology junkies. My youngest, though, is hard on tablets and devices because he drops them a lot. I have looked at different kid friendly tablets but had not found one that I really felt could stand up to other more expensive Android tablets. The Dragon Touch really shocked me with how great the quality was. The Dragon Touch Tablet is a 7 inch Android Tablet for kids. It comes with a thick protective case and it comes with a screen protector. The screen protector is already on the tablet so when the tablet arrives, you need to make sure that when you pull the tab labeled with a "2" that you are only pulling off the sheet covering the screen protector and not the entire screen protector. The case has cutouts for everything you need to get to such as the camera, speaker, SD card slot, audio jack, and charging port. It has buttons that cover the volume control so you have access to those as well. Everything that you need to get to on the actual tablet is available with the case so this means that my son does not have to take the case off the tablet to use it at all. This makes me feel better so that if he drops it, it is safe inside it's cover. When the tablet first arrived, we charged it and immediately downloaded some games on it like Minecraft, Sick Bricks, Talking Tom and others. We also made sure YouTube was working (my kids are addicted to watching Minecraft videos on YouTube). We have seven other tablets in our house - some name brand expensive tablets and some cheaper so we were really able to compare this tablet to our experience with the others. I love technology and have some basic understanding of processors, etc... This tablet has a quad core processor. I am not sure what our other tablets have but this tablet flies whether in a game or online. What we have found is that this tablet is extremely responsive. The screen is very sensitive to touch so you are not having to tap something multiple times to get it to respond. This was one thing I was worried about and it is great. We have not had any games or videos lag or freeze at all. We did take the micro SD card out of our other tablet and are using it in this tablet so that we don't use up all the memory on this tablet. The color on this tablet is vivid and sharp. Overall, I cannot tell much difference between this tablet and the much more expensive tablet we have except for the sound. The sound at it's loudest is just a little less than our other tablets, but my kids use headphones or no sound 90% of the time so this doesn't effect us at all. We have trouble sometimes with playing videos on other tablets because they either spend a lot of time loading or pause and this tablet has continued to play videos straight through. The WiFi picked up immediately and has worked great. We have used it in different locations with different internet connections and each time it logged on quickly and stayed on. Overall I can't find anything negative to say about this tablet. The protective case really makes this perfect for kids. The case is very well made and very nice looking. My son has not complained one time while playing with this tablet that any issues have occurred. I have played games like Talking Tom and the microphone works great. I have played with the kids on Minecraft on this tablet. This is just overall a great Android tablet for kids! I love now that I don't stress when my son has his tablet and is walking around or takes it places. This is definitely a 5 star item! I received this as a promotional sample in exchange for my evaluation and this honest, unbiased review.
RUQ1P8VQ7WE6S	5.0	I am so glad that after shopping around	18	18	I am so glad that after shopping around, I have found the perfect tablet for my 5 year old grandson. This is his 3rd tablet and the perfect fit where he can either learn or play. I like the parental guides, in this day and age, Lord knows we need them. It's perfect, absolutely so. I was wrong in saying that the camera isn't all that great in one of my reviews, it's pretty good, and like a lot of rear facing camera's, those pics aren't bad, but not as great as the front facing camera.
RZ3BY1UYC9ZGF	5.0	Prefect Tablet for all ages	30	33	I 💖💖💖 this tablet. I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter. But the tablet operates on Android, so adults would love it too.It was delivered on time. And it's simply. It doesn't move slow compared to the more expensive tablets. It's convenient for her & I'm actually jealous. I should've bought me one 😊
R1C7HR5UK2GPMM	5.0	This is a great tablet for our 10 month old daughter	14	14	This is a great tablet for our 10 month old daughter! So far the battery seems to lose it's charge quickly, but we downloaded a battery saver app today, so hopefully that'll work. Thanks for the speedy shipment!
RJT7WT8GP6EL0	4.0	It's no Nexus 7...BUT it's also much less expensive	29	35	 Please note: I received a free sample for evaluation and review. I apologize in advance for the length of the video that is almost 10 minutes long, and I'll summarize the highlights of my impressions below to save you some time. The video shows off the hardware (with the blue case, but it's the same otherwise) and software and will hopefully help you in your shopping if you're seriously considering buying this. Here's my bottom line - you don't pay much, and you get what you pay for. Take that how you want. :) It's a $60 tablet after all. I think that it's actually pretty good for the money, especially for young kids, but I want to help manage your expectations. Don't order this thinking that you're saving money because it's not a well-known brand name. You're saving money because it's a nicely designed tablet filled with lower end hardware. And you know what? That might be exactly what you want. I don't have kids, but I have a buddy who's kids (well, one in particular) consistently destroys electronics. I mean - destroys. Mostly the screens. MacBook Airs, iPhones, iPads...none survive. So, if your kids are like that, something like this might be a great choice. Well, or a box of crayons and blank paper. :D Sometimes, you should go old school. However, if you want to get your little wrecking ball a tablet, why not save some money in the process? Alright, here are the pluses that I've noticed: (*) Nice form factor and good feel to it - not too heavy, and not too light. It's like the Goldilocks of sizes for kids (*) GREAT cover, IMO. I love that thing. Comfortable, easy to grip, likely provides some protection (but I haven't hurled this at my brother...who also wrote a review, btw). Seriously - it's one nice cover (*) Comes with Android KitKat, and you can install any Android apps that you want (*) It comes with a "Kid Mode" for your kids that will lock them out of the normal functions, even if they try to reboot it (*) Decent speaker. Not great, but not too bad with the volume turned all of the way up...otherwise, it's pretty quiet (*) Despite no mention of it in the instruction, you can charge it via micro USB. I don't know why they even included a power adapter that most people will misplace. Just use one of the (I'm guessing) many cables that you already have for your phones/tablets to charge this up (*) It can help relieve your stress if your kid cracks the screen or throws it into a river, as compared to something more expensive (*) It might help your kids appreciate the more expensive tablets Some not-so-awesome aspects, which might not surprise you at this price point: (*) Off-axis viewing in one of the directions is atrocious. I'm not kidding. One might say that if a blind person was granted the gift of sight for the first time and opened their eyes to see this screen at an angle...it might be the most beautiful thing that they ever saw. Maybe. Darkness is close competition (*) Speed. Quad core or not, this certainly isn't the snappiest of tablets. That said, it's not horribly slow...but consider how patient your kids are (*) Whoever applied the included screen protector was either related to the owner of the factory or just generally didn't care at all. At all. Both my brother and I had pretty noticeable issues with those protectors. Mine had several dust particles (which cause bubbles) underneath. I just took it off...which brings me to the next point (*) The plastic (I'm pretty sure it's plastic) screen doesn't allow fingers to slide very well without that screen protector. So, if yours shows up as bad as mine, plan on buying another screen protector to put on it. Well, unless your kid destroys it first. :D (*) Battery life. Eeeee. Not a problem if your kid has ADD, but it's not going to last for hours like an iPad. I haven't pushed it to the limit, but it dropped over 10% in the time it took me to record the video. I had to charge it before the video because I had it in standby for about a day and it was totally out of juice. You probably want to grab a battery pack if you're taking a car trip or something (*) The cameras blow. Sure, they would seem like magic from someone from the 1500's. Okay, from the 1960's, even. Nowadays, though, they are below what I'd expect So, do I think it's worth it? That totally depends on what you want out of it. It's a decent tablet with some really basic software installed for your kids, but it's Android, so you can install any number of apps. If you want something cheap for your kids to play with - game on. If you're hoping to score a super tablet because it's an off-name brand...nope. It won't compete toe-to-toe with a higher-end tablet, but it's a LOT cheaper. A lot. That's the draw, and if that is attractive to you, then this could be a good option. I give it four stars because it's actually pretty cool for the price. If they were charging $100+, I'd bash them all day long. At $60 (currently), it's actually pretty good. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave me a comment and I'll respond as soon as I can. Thanks!
R3PSO5ND25N84R	1.0	no good	11	11	This tablet holds battery for only 1 hour and freezes a lot not a good tablet
RPOFQYZPVG8A	1.0	DON'T BUY!	41	51	In the description it says "Kid-Proof Case--Durable, lightweight case to protect against drops and bumps caused by kids at play." I had this tablet for 8 hours when it had broken in two different spots. My child was not allowed to leave the couch with the tablet. After sending pictures to the seller they replied "Thanks for sending us the photos .We forwarded the photos to our tech and they confirmed there should be some dropping on that corner part and caused the damage. In this case, our warranty won't cover under warranty." For them to advertise that their case would protect against dropping is ridiculous. My child dropped it from 12 inches on a a couch onto carpet and it smashed the screen in TWO places. The tablet won't even work anymore. The "warranty" won't cover anything. It had been less than 24 hours from the time it was dropped off until the time I had to send my email. BUT they will fix the damage for half the price of the product... Customer service is horrible, and as you can see English is choppy. You won't save any money by buying this tablet for cheaper than a durable one. Because it won't last.
RKBH7GLUIM8Q	1.0	Charger/adapter won't work.	13	14	I just bought this item for my grandson. The adapter/charger connector does not work. It won't go all the way in and won't charge. It is sad that it won't work. I just purchased it. Can you do something about it?

My son loved the device and it was definitely sturdy. However within two weeks of having it and taking our first road trip it refused to turn off. After letting the battery die, and charging the device again, it would only turn on while it was plugged in. Have been unable to attempt a seller contact until now due to being out of communication for work.
RXP486Y3O0AF7	4.0	The Buyers Review	14	16	I was asked to test and review this tablet. I can not and will not review this through a child's eyes and a child won't be buying this. I believe that an adult or teenager will have to set this up for a child anyway and then they will know how it works, to coach them with using it. If you want a kids tablet with all the most wanted apps and all ready to go, I don't know how likely it will be to find that, think of your own computers or phones that you've purchased for yourself to use. If you're new to this kind of equipment, maybe you should be buying a toy instead, because this is a fully functional tablet just like an adult model. I opened the package and was surprised to find a rather normal looking 7 inch tablet. Included with this is the pink bumper case, charger and USB cable. I pulled it out and went to charge it and was at first disappointed by the barrel end charger, which isn't universal. I've since contacted the seller and found out that the USB cable will charge it also and if you want a Second Wall Charger, that it is available also. So I'm okay with this setup. If you didn't realize it, this tablet is only Wi-Fi and not 3 or 4G. I scoped it out while charging it and found out about the one half gigabyte of RAM and 8 gigabytes of storage, which is hardly impressive, but you can use a micro SD card with it also, so the storage is okay. This has a 600x1024 screen which isn't great when compared to nice tablets, but it might be better than your laptop or desktop. Because this squeezed down to 7 inches is actually a fine resolution when you determine the pixels per inch, it's about the same as a 22 inch monitor at 1080 anyway, which is pretty good. The only other thing worth mentioning about viewing this screen is that the vertical angle is small, so you can move it to the right or left but not up and down, in your hand you'll get used to this though. I researched this ARM 1.2 GHz quad processor and found this to be okay too. This seems to be the Freescale i.MX6 version of the ARM Cortex-A9 or comparable and it uses DDR3 RAM, which some smart phones still don't use. Hey, except for the lower amount of RAM used and the vertical viewing angle, this hardware is all okay! The lack of RAM will never be a problem until you try to multi-task with this and you still can, but it'll be limited so close your programs. The last piece of the puzzle is the OS and you've got Android 4.4.2 and this is current and again, A-Okay. But don't ask me about children's games or Apps in general, I'm more of a hardware guy. Let's see how well it works! The first thing that I did was watch some TV on it and there's no problem with that. The only issues that I had was that the screen isn't slippery like I'm used to but I quickly got used to that and maybe some will put a protector on it anyway. The other is that it doesn't get real loud, which may be a blessing for parents, and you can't pair it BlueTooth to another speaker because it doesn't have it. I played a show while browsing the internet and it still worked normally, without bogging down. After 90 minutes of doing this I checked the battery and it had 56% left which ain't bad or good, but it works for me. This tablet also has a front and rear camera and they are functional. I use expensive cameras and lighting accessories and such, so I find all cameras like this useless for me. I can't say that you'll find these disappointing, but except for video phone use, I find the very best like this disappointing, so these are functional to me. I really like this Android version and on a 7 inch screen it's easier to use than on a smaller phone. You will be able to put current kid's stuff on this just fine. I haven't had a single issue using this just as I would my iPad Air. It appears that there is only a 90 day warranty from Tablet Express. Customer Service and Technical Support TEL：301-670-7335 (US) Mon-Fri 10am-5pm (PST) Email: cs_x@tabletexpress.com (US) csuk@tabletexpress.com(EU)--(EU&UK) So here's my summary of this tablet. At this price, it should not be compared to the current hot rod 7 inch tablets and it's only Wi-Fi capable. If you are a nit picker, you will also find some nits. But then maybe you should start your search for a tablet with the $150 Tab 4 and better. My only real problem is that I believe that this should have BlueTooth connectivity. Normally I wouldn't be so adamant about this feature, but combined with the low audio output I think many more would use it, there is a headphone jack to hard wire sound. This combination of low volume and the lack of BlueTooth connectivity is what dropped this product from 5 to 4 stars for me, however you might not think that it's an issue like I do. But it's also a perfectly capable tablet for most adults to use, much less children and my 25 year old daughter wants mine. Both the USB and the wall adapter is a 2 amp fast charge (verified with a test meter), and you can get a wall charger replacement or a second for more convenience if you'd like. The screen isn't high resolution until you realize that it is when you figure out the pixels per inch, then it might be high resolution compared to your computers monitor if you use a 24 or larger at 1080. It's lower amount of RAM will not bother most users and this is not slow, just a little slower than my new iPad Air. Now I first said that I don't think that your child will or should do the setup on this, so you should do the downloads and setup and maybe even turn the Wi-Fi off afterwards. So the biggest problem that I foresee is that if you don't have your own 7 inch tablet, you will have to ask your kid to borrow theirs to use, and then you'll have to turn it back on. You might want to pull it out of the pink case for a business meeting though. Dragon Touch will sell you other models much like this one, with choices of features and without the pink case too, if you find yourself playing tug of war with the kid. I am taking the $60 price of this into account and I'm kind of blown away by the value of this product when used by children during the day and snatched up by the parents at night. I think that it works great and after using it for the last two weeks I think that if you also take into account what I've told you about it, that you will be too. Recommended

R3FV0V948M099W	1.0	Junk Tablet.	6	6	I'm wondering if the positive reviews were paid for, because this tablet is a piece of JUNK. Was so excited when it arrived last week, but the thing keeps crashing, keeps freezing, and continually stops working. Every 15 minutes, no matter what app you're using, it crashes and a notification will pop up with "unfortunately (fill in the blanks) has stopped working". It's driving us insane! The Google Play store won't allow us to download anything because "item is not available in your country", Aptoide doesn't function on it either... Zoodles that's supposed to have preloaded games on it, keeps crashing all the time and stops working. The "games" aren't games but music videos from the mother goose club that you can watch on youtube, and one minute they will play fine, the next it just won't load! The camera has a blue haze to it, even for a kid tablet the quality is ridiculous. Don't waste your money on this, I believe the case that comes with it is more to protect the tablet from the frustrated parents who want to throw it against the wall, than for the kids dropping it.

R26MK68ZDDVNVH	1.0	very disappointed...	9	10	My 1.5 year old loves this tablet. He can stream pbs kids and netflix and play on his learning apps. I agree with other reviews though, when streaming it uses the battery up incredibly fast. I wouldn't recommend this tablet for kids over like 7 though-- the kids mode is incredibly easy to get out of. ****Update!**** its been about two weeks past a month that we've owned this and now on/off button doesn't work. My son is extremely disappointed.
R8457FCA4A7I1	1.0	Disappointed!	6	6	I am returning this tablet. From the git-go, the device is unable to download Adobe Flash which is needed to operate the Zoodles game software. Despite several emails back and forth with the manufacturer, I was unable to receive the assistance needed to resolve the matter. There was a bit of a language barrier and I became frustrated with all the work I was being asked to do (unsuccessfully) to work around the basic issue. Bummer.
R1MIRNQVGK8551	5.0	I love this tablet	9	10	I love this tablet! Runs just like an android phone so it's easy to use. My 2 year old loves playing games and watching spongebob on. I would recommend this tablet to anyone with children!
R2MZMRZZ59I0GH	1.0	TERRIBLE!!!	5	5	Within the first hours of me receiving this tablet I began to have problems! The Google Play Store Did not work nor had any connection to the app( even while the tablet was connected to Wifi) . Trouble shooting steps were taken and the issue still could not be resolve. As for the internet( constantly froze). Lastly the battery life is terrible!!! . I would not recommend this product to anyone. I guess you get what you pay for.
R22XC5S7J830IY	5.0	Save your own tablet's life	9	11	 This is not much of a video, I'm still learning. But it shows my son playing Minecraft with delight on this new tablet. The price alone is a great deal, you could practically get one for each kid and still pay less than your high end Ipad. This serves great, even for an adult. Here's some details: it plugs into a charger that is a round cylinder, but can also charge via USB. Both options. It lasts about 3 hours of constant use on Internet without a charge. It is Wifi but not 3g or 4g. There is a button for storage options. I used it to check my Gmail, to look up stuff on Google, and to play kids games. You can download games on to it. The color is great, better than my Kindle for crispness and color definition. It has a headphone port. It comes with a neat silicone cover that allows you to access buttons while the cover is on. This makes it safer for a kid (if they drop it) but my son preferred it without it. The Zoodles game was fun for my eight-year-old. It's simple to start up and use without a parent leaning over the head. And it's preloaded which is less problematic than downloading from online. It has a camera feature for front and back. It looks like a real tablet, as opposed to the childish looking LeapPad or LeapPad explorer, while the price is the same. It has far more functions that those do, and is sturdier too. I like this fact because I was spending $25 per LeapFrog game, and he got bored with them quickly. With this, he can play online games as well as go on Youtube. Less cost and more options is a very good thing. I highly recommend this as it allowed me to have my Tablet back and not have to search for where my kid has taken it. I wasn't able to listen to a podcast on this tablet, but it could be I would just need to sign in to a internet site to do that. It also works well to attach a simple small speaker unit into the headphone port to make the sound higher if you wish. I'm recommending this to my friend's with kids. I rec'd a sample of this product for inspection and review consideration.
R7D3LZ7GPWXCN	5.0	Great little tablet both for kids and parents.	7	8	This is a great little tablet for both for kids and parents. This tablet is equipped with a Quad Core CPU which allows it to boot up quickly. The tablet has a fairly good HD Screen. The tablet also comes with a durable, lightweight case to protect against drops and bumps. The tablet comes with a 1 YEAR defect warranty. I am glad I have this product and would definitely recommend it to others to use. Thank you for reading my review. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.
R1VC9DVVEYNJRN	3.0	Not a good battery life	25	33	This tablet is perfect for my 3 year old. The only drawback (which is a huge drawback for me) is the battery life. This battery stinks! He can barely get a few hours use out of it. To be fair, he does like to watch cartoons on Netflix a lot but holy cow...the kid is basically stuck to the wall by the charger cord every time he wants to use it.

R3MFYAZBN2RG73	1.0	I know it's cheap, but fix the BATTERY life!!!!	3	3	Purchased this item WITHOUT reading all of the reviews, good and bad first. Honestly, I saw that at of the over 1200 reviews, it still had a high rating so I let that drive me to purchase (I normally wouldn't do that because I'm a little to anal. I guess I was being lazy this time!) Well folks, laziness caused me to purchase THE WORST tablet for my 6 year old. My complaint is the same as most of the 390 negative reviews, the battery life sucks and is useless, and it can get "stuck" or freeze. The funny thing is, I ordered a replacement once I discovered the battery issue and the new one is doing the EXACT same thing! I literally charged the new one for 12 hours and it only had 97% battery life. Then, within about 4 minutes, it was down to 91% and I hadn't opened an app or done anything besides unlock the damn thing!! I am a person that always lives by the motto "You get what you pay for" and man did that kick me in the ass hard this time!!!! I would NOT recommend this tablet to anyone!

This is by far the worst thing I ever buy on Amazon!!! This tablet is extremely slow when i say slow i mean slow... Firstly the battery don't last long, secondly the volume is very very low and last but not least it's extremely very slow, my son he's 4 years old and i bought this for his birthday i thought he would like it... When it first came he was excited but when he gets to see it was dead slow he lost interest because sometimes he would be watching something educational and it would takes stopping and leading things like this make him lost interest in the tablet he don't play with it any more what a wast of money... My best advice would tell someone not to buy this pice of s***!!! I have included a picture of it just to show everyone how slow this thing really is.. It always stop stop.. :( :(

R1GTEVQOF94FVC	2.0	Bummed 2 year old	2	2	Okay so here's the thing, I have a 2 year old who LOVES playing with either mommy's or daddy's phone. While we both have Fisher Prive apps for her to play with we figured for her recent birthday let's get her a kids tablet to play with and we can call it her phone! We bought this tablet two weeks before her birthday and downloaded the apps she likes on to it. First off it's a thin cheap regular tablet that you have to put into the case and the case didn't fit right. It seemed kinda big for it and where they shove the bumper case into the box it was kinda bent on one corner and fit weird. However we dismissed this and still have it to her for her birthday day. She loved it! On our phones she makes a habit of pressing the home button and closing out her app she was playing on and would get frustrated. With the kid zone even if she hits the home button it won't close it out, it just goes back to re kid zone menu and to get out an adult has to enter their birth year. I really liked that feature. However there weren't too many games on there and there was only one ebook loaded for free. You have to pay for the others they have listed on there. Here's the bummer part that is kinda my daughter fault but mainly my mothers fault who watches her while I'm at work. My mom, knowing this is my daughters tablet tried to take it away from her in a hurry thinking and I quote "I thought she couldn't have it." My daughter when you try to hurry an take something away from her, as lots of kids do, threw it. The screen now has 2 cracks on one corner and won't work. It comes on, but you can't use it cause the digitizer is what broke. She didn't even have it a month. You'd think it being for kids that they would make a better bumper case so it can take falls that happen with children. I saw where Amazon Fire is making a tablet for kids that come with a 2 year deal where you can get a replacement for free if the tablet is broken. Gonna try that next I guess. Maybe I can get her broke one fixed then mama can have one of her own too :P Just PLEASE consider your kids dropping, throwing, tossing an playing rough with it before buying ANY tablet! This one will probably be better for older kids.
R2E4WUZ7JFTUC0	3.0	Don't buy it for Zoodles or for anything that requires Adobe Flash	2	2	I'm updating my review from a 1 to a 3 only because of the Amazon App Store - most of their games are compatible with Android 4.2 or higher and these devices are 4.3. Download the Amazon app store to your Dragon Touch to make life easier. It is a nightmare without doing so. The apps pre loaded on this device are basically false advertising and I've addressed this with Amazon. Many Google Play games require Adobe Flash and Zoodles is pretty much useless without Flash - this device is NOT compatible with Adobe Flash and it cannot be installed. The one good thing about Zoodles is the video mail set up. My son is deaf and this is a great way for me to chat with him when out. So if you are going to buy this be prepared to not be able to use Zoodles except for a few videos and maybe one book, or much of anything in Google Play. There are other posts that talk about Disney and PBS and such but the games play incredibly slow on this device so probably not your best option. Original comments below - know what you are NOT getting with this device I bought two of these tablets, and one arrived with bubbles under the actual screen. In addition, after many attempts at trying to get the correct Adobe option to download it finally did on one of them but then trying to use Zoodles is a joke. What they advertises simply isn't accurate. I specifically bought these so my kids had only one place to go to play educational games on their very long bus ride to and from school everyday. Huge disappointment. Zoodles later tells you not all segments of their programs will work on certain types of devices. We tried the free version because it showed a lot of games and books on the site but in reality, one book, NO games and just a bunch of little short videos and an art screen. It's horrible and in my opinion, if you are buying it for Zoodles, don't buy it. I'm not paying for premium memberships to Zoodles because I suspect I will see very limited results because of the lack of support the device has. I've been trying to reach both companies with no luck but expect similar results as other people have seen. Depending on what the outcome from their responses are, these will most likely be going back early next week. I'm done wasting time messing with these.
R2V4C33PA8J63K	4.0	Unusable out of the box, nice tablet once fixed; please read for EXTENSIVE caveats and instructions	2	2	 Note: the video and the review below are from my review of the Pink version of this, but it is exactly the same tablet with a different-colored case. Any photos mentioned below are in that review (it's not easy adding photos after you've added video, and there are only so many hoops I'll jump through). I'm including this here because I think it's important for potential owners to realize that this has issues out of the box - significant issues - but that they are almost all easily resolved in less than 30 minutes. It's the time-price you pay for the low cost of this tablet. ----------------------- *** PLEASE NOTE THAT THE VIDEO REVIEW IS *AFTER* I DID THE MODIFICATIONS DESCRIBED BELOW - IT DOES *NOT* WORK LIKE THAT OUT OF THE BOX *** *** PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT YOU *NEED* TO INVEST ABOUT HALF AN HOUR IN SETTING THIS UP PROPERLY; IT IS USELESS OUT OF THE BOX (SEE BELOW) *** I want to say right off the bat that I received a free sample for evaluation. As a result of that, though, I did some things with this that I might have been afraid to do had I bought it, so allow me to be your guinea pig. You'll note that I gave it four stars. I believe it deserves those stars, but not out of the box. You'll need to tinker a bit. I'll tell you what issues I had with it as-sold, and how I fixed them, and as a result why I think it's a four-star purchase, given the price. Note the "given the price" bit, because otherwise, you should buy the FireHD Kids Edition Tablet. Of course, it's almost *three times as expensive* (give or take, depending on screen size and such). My co-worker has one for his son, I've played with it, and it is noticeably better than this tablet in every category... unless you absolutely must have Play Store access (which is a nice thing, don't get me wrong, and which the Kindles don't have). But, again, it's *much* more expensive, and you'll likely looking at this because you don't have $150+ sitting around to spend on a tablet for your young child/grandchild/favored pet. So let's see how this can work for you. Truly, it can. You'll just need to do a few things. First, let's tear it down before we build it back up, shall we? There are some problems with this, and you can't fix all of them. Trust me, though, in the end, we'll see the (four) stars shine. But there's a storm to deal with before then. *** Please understand that I do think this is a good tablet, once "fixed", but there are a lot of initial issues, and you should be aware of them. I apologize for the length of text below, but I think it's important. *** * Issue #1: THE INCLUDED CHILDREN'S SOFTWARE IS ATROCIOUS. I cannot even adequately describe how bad it is, but I'll try. *THIS IS THE REASON YOU BOUGHT THIS TABLET* and it is horrifically, unusably, unforgivably bad. It's called Zoodles. You should not use it. First, after turning on WiFi (because - see below - it doesn't come enabled), you will go to the Applications Viewer (the icon to touch looks like two rows of three dots each in a circle on the middle of the bottom of the screen) and open the Parent Dashboard app. How did you know to do so? Answer: you didn't. Anyway, it'll ask for your birth year. Guess what? This is the PIN to keep kids from using other apps, and when you need to enter it in any of the Zoodles apps, it asks you specifically for "your birth year", not "your PIN", so if your kid knows when you were born, the jig is up. Of course, you can enter a random PIN anyway, but it doesn't tell you the birth year will be used as a PIN or that it'll be referred to as your birth year. Also, your PIN has to be a reasonable birth year (example: 5612 didn't work). So, so, *so* bad. Next, it'll ask for an email. Use a dummy one (see below). Then, it'll try to sell you on the $5/month premium package, which isn't included, obviously. Without it, there's not a lot you can do to restrict how your child uses the tablet. Then it'll tell you you need to install Flash Player. Flash Player was a useful thing, and the Internet would have died without it, perhaps, but it's no longer part of Android, and these games won't run unless you download a version of Flash Player. It'll tell you that, and it'll tell you to go into Settings->Security and enable the "Unknown Sources" check box, which will warn you not to do that, but the instructions tell you to check it anyway. If you know what you're doing, that's fine, but it's a terrible thing to tell people to do in general. Anyway... while I didn't spend *too* long on it, it didn't work for me, even following the steps, and I'm quite tech savvy. Maybe I missed a step. The point is: this should have been included in the software shipped with this tablet if it is essential to using kid's mode - and it is. So, let's say that, like me, you couldn't get it installed. In that case, Zoodles is basically worthless. The "games"? They're all YouTube videos. Yay. The art app? Good luck drawing with it: not all the touches register, so... kids will get annoyed. There are books to read, and you can record yourself reading them in a video, but... you're using the low-quality cameras to do so, and as a result I can't recommend that. You can send mail if you set it up, supposedly, but... look, the point is, this is a train wreck. It's an abomination. It is unusable. But... see below. We can fix this. It's just unfortunate that we have to. * Issue #2: Non-standard power cable. This is borderline unacceptable - the tablet *has* a micro USB port, so you'd think it could be charged with a ubiquitous USB charger, but instead it comes with a proprietary cable that has a small, thin tip (prone to breaking, I'd think). Furthermore, the charger doesn't plug all the way it - it protrudes maybe ~1/5" (~0.5cm) from the charging port. Fortunately, the silicone bumper case hides all that and also helps protect the plug, so this is all more of an inconvenience than a deal breaker. The biggest issue with it is that you'll need to get an AC inverter (like, say, this) for your car if you want to bring this anywhere and expect it to last more than a few hours. *EXCEPT*... late-breaking news: YOU CAN CHARGE IT WITH THE MICRO USB PORT. I *just* discovered this in a "what the heck, I'll just try it" moment (again, because I didn't pay for it, so I can take the risks for you). Yes, you can charge it like any other micro USB device. It appears it takes longer, and maybe it's charging at 500mA instead of the 2A the charger provides (despite me using a 2.4A-capable micro USB charger), but I have no idea why they don't mention this. It means you can charge it like other devices and can still use it if the proprietary cable breaks. * Issue #3: The user manual. It is really, really, *really* out of date. It mentions the Android Market. That's what Google Play Store used to be called *over three years ago*. It shows screen renderings of earlier, pre-Android 4.4 (pre-Android 4.x, it seems) screens. So, yes, it's sort of useful, maybe, but not so much. You're as likely to find bad info here as good. I'd ignore it. Let me (and, of course, the Internet) be your guide. * Issue #4: The initial way it comes set up (aside from the terrible kid's software). When you turn it on, the home screen has no apps and WiFi is not enabled. If you don't know your way around Android, you're sort of out of luck here. Yes, you can look at the user manual, and, if you really look hard, you can decipher how to enable WiFi, but it's not apparent. Again, let me be your guide. * Issue #5: The cameras are identical, and *really* low quality. I've attached some photos. The ones of the box this came in were taken by the front and back cameras. Doesn't really matter which is which - they seem to take identical photos. Also, they are saved as 1600x1200 resolution images. They are *not* that good. They are *maybe* 640x480 (but muddled), blown up to fit the larger size. Small kids won't mind. Everyone else probably will. There's an option in the camera app to use the lower resolution. Do so - the larger resolution takes up more space but provides zero extra actual image precision. * Issue #6: The touch screen has a ~1/2" x ~1/2" (~1cm x ~1cm) square in the upper right corner that doesn't accept touch input. I used the built-in developer mode as well as a free app to verify this: it just doesn't register touches there. Sadly, that's where a lot of close/search/menu items are. Solution: rotate it 180° so the bottom left becomes the upper right, and it'll work for you. But you shouldn't have to do that. * Issue #7: The screen is horrible off-axis. Horrible. Dead-on, it's actually pretty good, color wise. I've attached a photo of my awesome Pacific Rim Jaeger (the Gipsy Danger... and no, it isn't "Gypsy") holding it, and you can see the colors well. Note that the moire pattern is an artifact of taking the photo - the colors are solid. But move it even a little - and I'm talking 5 degrees - and it is much, much worse. This tablet could be shared by two side-by-side kids only if they're small enough not to care that it looks the way it will to at least one of them. Speaking of screens: one of the photos shows an HDMI port. This doesn't actually have one (but it's not mentioned, either... I think it's just a photo of a different version). * Issue #8: Headphones are essentially required. Yes, it has a speaker, and yes, you can hear it, but in any real-world environment, it's likely not loud enough. Maybe it is, but I can assure you this won't blow your eardrums. So maybe that's a plus. * Issue #9 Developer mode is enabled. This isn't a *huge* deal, but it's something that typically only developers use, and it can mess up your device if not used properly (example: tell it to use the ART runtime instead of Dalvik - just one little checkbox tiny fingers could find! - and it'll brick the tablet). There is no reason for this to be the case. ----------------- So... how do we fix this? Because, right now, it's looking like 1 star. A complete waste. A call to return it to Amazon. Crying children. Teeth being gnashed. Yelling. Questions of "how did my life end up here?" Let me help. I'm going to step through this from the very beginning. To do that, I'm going to factory-reset my tablet. I'll tell you how to do that, too, in case you ever need to (please note that you DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS if you just opened the tablet and likely not even if you're played with it a lot; I'm just telling you how, just in case): Factory Reset directions: * If your tablet *isn't* unusable, make sure it's on, then press and hold the power button long enough to see the Power Off/Reboot/Silent mode screen, then click Reboot and say OK (if your tablet *is* unusable, press and hold the power button until it starts to reboot, or, if it's off, just long enough to get it started powering on). IMMEDIATELY press AND HOLD *both* volume buttons until you see the Dragon Touch image show up, blink, and be replaced by a screen with the Bugdroid (little green Android guy) image in the background and some text in the foreground. THIS MIGHT TAKE 15 SECONDS OR SO. KEEP THOSE BUTTONS HELD. STAY ON TARGET. If nothing appears for 20 seconds, it probably isn't powering on, so try again. They key is to get those volume buttons down before it starts to boot, immediately after it goes to power on and before you can see anything on the screen. * Once you see Bugdroid, use the Volume Down button to scroll to "wipe data/factory reset" (you can also use Volume Up to scroll up if you go past it), then click the Power button to select it. * On the next screen, again use the Volume Down button to go to "Yes -- delete all user data" and use the Power button to select it. * When that's done (maybe 10 seconds or so), "reboot system now" will be selected - press the Power button to do so. Wait for it to reboot. Starting from the beginning (upon opening the box or after resetting... modify as appropriate if you've already used it a bit): * You'll be greeted with the initial colors-and-butterflies screen. If you powered on and walked away, you might need to unlock it - just put your finger on the lock in the circle and drag it to the "unlocked" icon. If the screen ever goes black, click the power button and do this again. * You'll then be told to make yourself at home... just click "OK". This might not happen for tablets right out of the box, but it will for factory reset tablets. * At some point now or soon, you might be asked if you want to share your location. Do as you wish. * You'll see a little gear icon on the bottom left, next to the camera icon. Click it. It takes you to Settings. Note that you can also slide a finger down onto the screen (from the very top) on the right side, and you'll see the Settings gear there, too. I mention this because that gear in the tray that you likely just clicked can be moved. * You'll see WiFi is off - it's there on the upper left. Click (or slide) it to on. You'll see available WiFi hotspots. Hopefully you'll know one of them. Click it, enter the password, and log in. Advanced users will know how to do other things, but most will click and log in. * While still in Settings - or once back there - scroll down on the left to "Apps" and click it. On the right, you'll now see the downloaded apps that came with this. For each of them: click it, then on the next screen click "Uninstall", then click OK. You don't need them. Removing them will free up space and memory. Once each is done, move to the next (it might not disappear until you've clicked the next thing). There are likely three altogether. If things seem to freeze, click something other than Apps on the left, then click back. * Next, use your finger and slide the right side over from "Downloaded" to "Running" (just drag your finger to the left). Click on Kid Mode and click Stop. Say OK when it asks. Why do this? It removes some strain from the system, since you won't be using it. * Next, slide over to "All" from "Running" (with your finger, like before). In there, for each of the following, click the app, then click "Force Stop" (if available) and "OK", then "Disable" and say OK, then click the back arrow on the bottom of the screen (2nd from the right, next to the volume-up icon). This will free up system resources BUT THEY ALL SEEM TO COME BACK ON A REBOOT. Note this, because you'll need to do this the next time you reboot, probably, to save on resources. Anyway, those unneeded apps include Browser, Email (unless you want email on this), Exchange Services, Kid Mode, Sound Recorder (unless you want that), and Zoodles Game Player. Others, maybe, but do NOT do this with any apps that show the green Android guy. * You might want to move down to Developer options, click on it, and slide the main switch to "Off" - there is no reason to have this on for 99% of the people who will buy this tablet. * Now that you're done with that, hit the Home icon (center, bottom) and get out of Settings. * Now is a good time to learn how to get applications out of memory, since you have so little. Click the Recent Apps icon (bottom, second from left, looks like one rectangle in front of another), then you'll see Settings. Touch it briefly and "flick it" up - you'll just land a finger on it and swipe up; you won't touch it for more than a brief moment. Remember how to do this, because you should frequently clear out apps in memory that you aren't using. You don't *have* to, but it'll help on this tablet to do so. * Let's clear away some apps from the dock/tray. Note: any apps you see on the home screen aren't actually the apps, they're just a link to the app. Deleting these won't delete the apps, it'll just remove the link. You can easily replace them if you change your mind. Anyway, let's say you don't need your child messing around with the File Manager - it's the thing that looks like a filing cabinet. Touch the icon and, while keeping your finger on it, drag it to the `x' that'll appear with "Remove" next to it at the top of the screen. Poof! Gone. Do that with other things you don't want your kids to use. It's not like they can't get to them via the Applications View icon (the dots in the circle), but at least it's less easy to do so. * You can open the Applications View (click that icon) and drag icons from there to the home screen(s) to place links there. You can drag them to the screens themselves, or, for a limited number of them, to the tray at the bottom. The tray stays in place when you slide between home screens. This is standard Android stuff. You can read about it elsewhere. * Now let's add some apps. Click on the Play Store icon (either on the tray or, if you removed it, in the Applications View). It'll ask you for your Google account. STRONG ADVICE: make a new one unless you're positive you want to use yours. It can be anything you want, just don't forget the account name or password. Why will you do this? Because you can set this up with NO payment info, so your kid *cannot* ring up charges no matter what. Anyway, set up the account (or sign into yours), skip the payment info (if it's a new account), and go to the Play Store. * Choose apps and download them. Netflix works. Angry Birds works. Club Penguin works. Etc. (The Disney Channel app doesn't seem to, for some reason, at least for me). Find some apps that don't need Wifi and others that do... you just need a few that don't need it so your kid can use this in the car/while out. Even if you skipped entering payment info, you can download free apps. You can also get a Google Play card and load funds that way... that would let you set a limit on what can be bought but wouldn't force your child to use only free apps. * These apps will show up on your home screen. Move them around as you wish. Again, standard Android stuff you can read about elsewhere. There are millions of apps. I am *sure* you can find a good selection for your kids (and you). You should be good to go. You can now use most Android references to decide what to do next (apps to get, how to change wallpaper, etc.). I recommend downloading Google Play Launcher instead of the default launcher, but that's your call. I also go into Settings and change things like the time until the display sleeps, etc. Again, it's all your call. If you do all this, do you lose the ability to control when and for how long your kid plays? No, not really. Just take the tablet. Or, better, just keep the charger. This won't last long without one. So... why four stars? Yes, it is set up badly - unforgivably badly - out of the box. But most of the issues are resolvable, and it's now a decent, usable, kid-friendly $60 tablet. The silicone bumper is great (note: it'll pick up dirt and stains easily, but, hey, you've got kids, so that's not unusual to you). The fact you can charge it faster with the built-in charger but also can charge via micro USB is very nice... even more so because, if one of those two ports gets broken, you can use the other to charge (pro tip: use electrical tape to block one of them so it's available if the other is jammed with peanut butter). It accepts microSD cards, so you can put movies and such on those and watch with the included UHD Player app or with others, like MX Player (or MX Player Pro, which I prefer). Battery life isn't phenomenal, but it isn't bad for this class of tablet either. Note that this isn't even remotely waterproof, so be careful around fluids. If your kid is especially spill-friendly, you might want to tape up all sorts and untape the charging one only when charging. It's up to you. So, after some work, I actually like this tablet. I have to say that, out of the box, I wasn't fond of it. Now, though, it's quite usable. It just took a little effort. But not too much. It's unfortunate it took any, though.
R3IK0PDPWRD4IP	2.0	Not very kid friendly!	3	3	I had purchased another tablet for my grandkids. It did not hold a charge well, but definitely surpassed this tablet for being kik friendly. It came loaded with educational apps. This one, you need to load your own and then it only includes one free game. It is a very disappointing purchase.
R2IS3DWLITFDA8	2.0	Not worth the money	3	3	I ordered this tablet for my daughter for her birthday. A day after I give it to her, ether the charge port or the charger the tablet came with stopped working and would no longer charge the tablet. We can only charge it now in the USB port. Also, extreme lagging and very limited space.
R1QM8OESCFYQDX	3.0	Not what I expected for Kid Mode	3	3	This product didn't impress me at all. I have had difficulty with accessing zoodles for my daughter and when it did enter in kid mode, I couldn't exit out of kid mode. All the other features work fine but I bought this tablet for my 3 year with the purpose of using kids mode.
R1H2503GAP11XX	4.0	Great product! Got it for my sons 6th bday ...	3	3	Great product! Got it for my sons 6th bday as he asked for a tablet... perfect for his age and a good price... only downfall is battery doesn't last very long or I would give it a 5!
R18Y8MTA0LLN12	2.0	Power button stopped working after 2 hours	2	2	Upon receiving the product we initially were satisfied. We downloaded all of my sons favorite apps. He watched streaming videos on PBS kids app no problem. There was no lag or delay. The video quality was acceptable. The camera quality was pretty fuzzy reminded me of old school web cams. But this was for a 3 year old, so it was no big deal. The deal breaker was about 2 hours into owning the tablet, the power button stopped working. Which meant it totally stopped working. I'm pretty disappointed. I didn't expect an iPad mini for $60, but I did expect a working tablet. Upon looking at the reviews, there have been more complaints about the power button issue lately. There must be a defective batch!
R348BXH9754T1G	3.0	it came today and is a black one instead of the green-I am sure it works perfectly but for the first time in a long time I am ve	2	2	this was purchased for a 7 year old boy-for his birthday-I thought the green color would be inspiring and help him find it easily-guess what ? it came today and is a black one instead of the green-I am sure it works perfectly but for the first time in a long time I am very disappointed in the product-I cant send it back because his birthday is fast approaching-but I am very disappointed in the department that did the packaging-I will be very wary of ordering things like this in the future-
R12WVVGL15DODT	2.0	Meh... I'm returning it.	2	2	Maybe I've been spoiled by my iPad. Maybe I shouldn't complain too much since the tablet is only $60 and for my son, but I'm not impressed or satisfied. The thing is slow and isn't very sensitive. We're constantly waiting... You have to press things several times and it takes a long time to load. My son is constantly coming to me saying something is not working. I feel like if we keep it we'll be unhappy and constantly telling ourselves that it was only $60 to excuse it.
RB8DJQSNCQO8F	4.0	Very Nice	2	2	To be blunt about it, I thought it would be a piece of crap. But it fairs very well with my little sister. She loves watching Netflix and Kids YouTube on it. I like how you can actually download apps for it, I think it can pass off as an adult tablet. My only complaints are the battery life (Does not last more than 2 hours when in use) and the charger it came with broke fairly quickly. Luckily a regular phone charger can charge this puppy back up, so that wasn't as bad.
R2MH1782RFN1PY	1.0	Get a (battery) life!!	2	2	The battery will not hold a charge. I have charged it on numerous occasions for the 10 hours as suggested by the manufacturer, but it loses battery life within minutes. If it is put up for a day or two, when we come back to use it, it's dead. I am going to call the manufacturer and hope I am able to exchange it. If not, I'm stuck with a piece of junk.
R3OJ9OOLG898N7	5.0	love it :)	2	2	Love it i got 2 of them onefor my 2 year old and one for my 4 year old and they love it it was worth it and its so easy to use the protecter its perfect thinking of getting more for my nefews and niace.defecnally a great gift for a kid in any ocation the price its just rite the touch capa its very good and wifi not slow at all a
R1RWFMY9OZ61UK	1.0	Terrible!!!	2	2	We purchased this tablet for my son and it was a nightmare from the start. We can download Apps that usually take a few hours to complete. Watching videos is out of the question. The screen freezes up so i have to reboot it to get it working again. Such a waste of money. I would never buy it again.
R3JNOY3ZVYMXSL	1.0	ABSOLUTE GARBAGE !!!!	2	2	If I could give no stars I would have. ABSOLUTE PIECE OF CRAP !!! As soon as the returnable time frame was up (30 days) Power button broke and charging pin that accepts the charger broke as well. Now. Absolutely useless. $60 wasted right here.
R7LRJMVCWZMGR	2.0	Battery life is not the greatest either.	2	2	While I don't expect it to be very fast or top quality due to it's $60 price tag, I do expect it to work. I've already had to do a hard reset after only a few hours of kids Youtube. Hopefully it doesn't die over the next few months. Battery life is not the greatest either.
R2CU0UCAJRDBGD	2.0	Awkward interface, many apps force close, battery life is terrible...	1	1	If I hadn't received this as a gift I would have returned it. The screen interface is completely digital, there are no buttons. You have to touch and drag from the top of the screen to get the back and home buttons and all that. This doesn't always seem to work. I see my son touching multiple spots trying to get it to appear, like there are dead spots on the screen or something. Also, many of the apps we have tried to downloaded will load and work for a couple of seconds but then force close so it seems that whatever OS this thing uses isn't compatible with several games. The cameras, both front and back, seem to be the same quality and neither are good, which is fine for kids that are just playing. The battery life is abysmal. With maybe about an hour of use the battery has gone from 99% to 25% (it never seems to get to 100%... glitch maybe?). The load is so heavy that it loses charge EVEN WHILE IT IS PLUGGED IN. it was at 99% and I hopped on for 5 minutes to play a game and it went down to 95%, again, it was still plugged in an losing charge while in use. It charges quickly with the tiny pin plug but also comes with a typical smartphone type (I don't know the technical name) and that is fine too but perhaps not as fast and it's just the cord, so you need a usb ready wall pull or an adapter. Its hard to find the words to describe how poorly designed and awkward this unit is. I'd highly advise spending a bit more and getting a name brand unit. The only upside is that, because it is so awkward and crappy, my 6 year old almost never wants to play with it so at least we're keeping screen time to a minimum.
RBGJWWQJ9FPZN	1.0	Buy a real tablet, not a cheap one like this	2	2	Very cheap, and the protective cover is useless. On day 3, my son barely dropped it on the carpet and now the power button is broken. I don't think it's fixable and we can't use the tablet anymore because the power button doesn't press.
R3NL8BMR52L35W	1.0	The battery was no good in this tablet	2	2	The battery was no good in this tablet. The very first time I turned it on, it was getting hot and the battery percentage was going down really fast. My baby likes zoodles website but nothing on the app, on this tablet was free.
R14FIUO9J1K2C	4.0	got this as an easter gift for my 3year old	1	1	This came in today and its ok for the price the two brother's review helped a lot I'm glad I looked at them I believe my 3 year old will like this but I won't know till Easter that what I bought it for so now adding apps ill do an update after I let her play with it Update 3/30/2015 this is more of a parent help tip I know the preloaded parental control doesn't work I downloaded the app Dinnertime Plus I paid for the updated version you download it on the tablet or and your smart phone you can control which apps they can open or not if you can set daily time limits and it will pull a screen up on her tablet or phone tell her time is up it will not take that one off unless you grant more time you can grant for only one or more app if you wish it give you an update of what is being used on the tablet or phone also up to 7 days back you can view how long they use each app as well you set up to how many hours and set it to lock down at dinner and bed time a break or nap time if they are still taking naps also has a "pause" button which you can use at anytime to lock the device also shows what app they are currently using so if you disapprove you can close the app and place it on the "lock list" it keeps those apps from being used you can put any app on the tablet in this list (if its a predownloaded you need to disable it first which most you probably already have if you set it up like the brothers describe)
RW0NVGL0AO81G	2.0	Terrible sound and very average performance.	1	1	To make a few things clear: This is a lower-end, budget Android tablet that comes with a protective cover and Zoodles installed (basic, not premium). It doesn't have any kind of proprietary "kid friendly" software installed other than Zoodles, it could just as easily be used by an adult. Biggest problems: The sound level is TERRIBLE. It's impossible to hear anything without head phones, period. Don't even bother trying to watch Netflix without headphones in, you won't be able to hear it. The battery charges fast, but also drains quickly, so that's kind of a push. You will find, however, that it's very difficult to insert the battery plug into the slot with the protector on it; it simply doesn't fit without forcing it. It's also fairly slow, at least compared to most modern smart phones or premium tablets. Look, it's a very basic tablet. For the price, compared to others on the market, it's incredibly average. It isn't terrible, but it isn't up to an acceptable level in my opinion. I realized pretty quickly that we were going to have to replace it, as my HTC One M8 phone has a volume several multiples higher than this tablet does. Headphones are not optional. If you absolutely have to stick to this price range, this is probably a decent deal, since it includes the case protector. Otherwise, I strongly advise spending a few extra dollars and going with a better tablet.
R1JHZGGS5BX0DL	1.0	Do not buy this product!!!!	2	2	I bought this in July and it only gets used maybe twice a week for an hour at the most each time since then and while charging it melted the plastic. I never noticed the melting because I had the protective cover on it.
R1R6IJH9RW6BT5	1.0	waste of money and not safe	2	2	I hate these I bought 2 and they only get a half hour charge on the batteries witch made me mad then one got so hot in my son's Han the screen shattered what a waste of my money I thank God my son did not get hurt
R2X4MWT7RQQYCJ	4.0	Good tablet for the money!	1	1	I'm giving this tablet 4 out of 5 stars because it is a decent tablet for the price. Would I buy it for myself, no, but for my 2 year old cousin it's perfect. She comes over to visit often and she was always using my phone, which having an expensive iphone 6 plus, I didn't want her to break it. This was a perfect alternative and she loves it! I set her up and she is good to go for a few. It has great games and features. The case is pretty cute and chunky for little fingers to hold onto. It is a little slow and sometimes I can't see what I am typing because it just doesn't show it when the keyboard is up, like most tablets would, but aside from that, it's great... especially for the price! You can't beat this tablet for the $$. Read the other reviews and go through the steps that the one person said, because yes.... it isn't ready right out of the box. The flash player I am still confused on how to download, but it hasn't stopped her from playing any of the games or anything so we are fine with my confusion. An added bonus is that they send you a step by step guidance on how to rate the product on amazon and they will send you a free protective case once you have reviewed... AWESOME! So... overall, good tablet, great buy for a little one!
R2TZGWJVXC8GZR	2.0	disappointed	2	2	This tablet is great - when it works - however most of the time you will be frustrated with it loading. YouTube KIDS loads better than, say, PBS but overall it is a huge LET DOWN!
R3OMOYZK81VJ9S	5.0	Very Surprised!	1	1	We just received the Kids PK Dragon Touch Y88X tablet and I must say that for the price I am very impressed! I was expecting a clunky tablet that would be slow but we received just the opposite. The size is very comparable to a Kindle Fire 7" and with the quad-core processor it responds very quickly. We had the SD card from my granddaughters broken tablet and when we slipped it in all her content came right up! And as a bonus there is the Zoodles software (seems to work very well), a great pink thick rubbery case and even had a screen protector already applied! Even though we purchased this for our grandchild, it is very suitable for an adult also and with the price point, would be a great traveling companion for the hazards on the road. In conclusion: we have a grandson that is almost ready for a tablet and I will definitely be picking up another one of these - blue case of course!
R2VI7I4P9E0JO8	5.0	Great tablet for kids	1	1	What a great tablet! I got this to watch movies with my son, and for him to play game apps. It works very well for that. I would recommend getting some good screen protectors, as the screen protector (if it is one) that is included with the tablet is not very good. At first, I thought that my son had scratched the screen on the first day of use, but it was just marks on the screen protector. After removing that, the screen was nice and clear. I got some generic screen protectors that I had to cut down to size, but I am planning on getting the protectors designed for this tablet. There have been a few isolated cases of games running slow, but I am pretty impressed with the size and speed of the tablet, and the clarity of the screen. I had first bought a $40 tablet on Amazon, but was not satisfied with that one. The extra money for this tablet, even though this one is still pretty cheap, is well worth it.
R2K6RG48IUTR1U	5.0	This tablet is great for kids	2	2	This tablet is great for kids. its perfect size and keeps them happy. they love it and don't want to put it down.
R1G0XBL715KNZX	5.0	Durable and easy to use	1	1	I purchased this for a friend's 2 year old child. She's constantly wanting everyone's smartphones, tablets, handheld gaming systems, and pretty much any electronic lol. When we gave her this, she loved it. The tablet comes with some already installed kid games and of course you can get more from the app store. It's powered through android so it's an excellent product and easy to use. My final point is the durability of the device. She has dropped the tablet so many times already and everything still works perfectly fine. Not to sure how well my review will hold up if you took off the case, but if your buying this for a kid, you should definitely keep the case on.
R3MM4HIBC2808S	5.0	first and didn't love it, so we returned it	1	1	We ordered the Nabi Jr. first and didn't love it, so we returned it. We felt that our daughter would outgrow the Nabi Jr. quickly due to its limited availability for free children's apps. In turn, we decided to order the Dragon Touch, and we love it! So does our daughter! She has been using my ipad and this has the same functions but in a cheaper form and better case in case it gets dropped. The screen size is a bit smaller than the ipad, but she doesn't seem to mind at all. She can still access pictures and Youtube kids. I feel this is a pad that will grow with her as she continues to develop and gets older.
R38XFR6UF7NJ4K	1.0	Screen cracked on second day after open	1	1	Bought at end of May for one child and that child happen to get a tablet from someone else so I held onto this for another child (never opened it). Gave to the other child at the end of July (opened for the first time) and screen cracked on the second day it was opened. We had put a screed protector on it as soon as we opened it and now with the screen cracked the touch screen won't work and you cannot get past the startup locked screen. We are not happy with our purchase. Two of my other children have different types of tablets and none of them have ever had any issues and one tablet is going on 2 years.
R1KSM3FK277KRC	5.0	Five Stars	2	2	Excellent tablet, great performance for the price, Android KitKat and Google Play Store.
R2H19XAYJ89QJN	1.0	safety hazard - should not be given to children	1	1	I bought two of these tablets, one after the other, in the last 90 days. Two because the glass broke on the first one broke from being sat upon. The second one died today because a six-year-old had his thumb on the screen while unplugging the power charger, the incredible pressures generated by child's thumb shattered the screen. Luckily he's not hurt. Please pay attention to what the other user's are saying about the glass quality. Visualize your child putting a finger or thumb through the paper-thin glass. Then make your purchasing decision.
R2BQQLW53IPV4W	5.0	Great for a 9 year old	1	1	I got this for a 9 year old, and he loves it. The case is very sturdy, and he has yet to have problems with the apps and performance, unlike his previous tablet (a Dopo that crashed the exact same time as another family member's Dopo.) I don't think he plays with the games that came with the tablet, but that's fine. I think they're geared for someone a little younger than he is. I would totally recommend this for any parents that question the safety of kids on a tablet. There are lots of parental controls.
R3L4D4XA3WJGTO	5.0	Amazing Affordable Tablet	1	1	Buying this tablet for my daughter has been one of the best investments I've made. No longer do I have to give her my phone for her to watch YouTube. She now has all her favorite shows at her fingertips. It's not slow and yes it's a regular tablet! Meaning you can download whichever apps you want on it. I enabled kids mode that way I'm confident that she can only access content for her age. I love love love this tablet. I highly recommend it for any parent looking to entertain their children on a budget.
R2DJZ73MAV5UR	5.0	One of the Best Bargins on Amazon	1	1	 This tablet is perfect for children and adults. It is faster than our Dell 7 tablet that cost twice as much. Connects easily to the internet. Nice options for children with built-in apps that allow parents to restrict what they can access. The cover is one of the best I have seen for protection. I received a demo model for my honest review. If I were looking for a new inexpensive 7 inch tablet, this would be my choice.
R3F5D4NGSWOUH5	5.0	Great Product	2	2	Its the best thing for my son. This tablet is great for his age.
R2KXQ4O8EA17AC	5.0	I really like it but wish the volume could go a little ...	1	1	It's a mini pad, I really like it but wish the volume could go a little louder. Excellent purchase for the money. My granddaughter loves it, she is only 1 but she will be able to use it for many years, you can download anything you want for what ever age your child is. An adult can also find this to be a very useful notepad, it basically does everything a computer does, check your emails, facebook, google etc.!
R3K8V3ZJZEYNAD	5.0	Baby's first tablet	1	1	Excellent "disposable" touch screen for the 2 yr old. It's not a great screen, but I figured at $50, who cares. I wanted a starter tablet before spending the bucks to go Fire HDX + Prime video + Parental Controls - this one should do the trick for a year before the kid is savvy enough for more. It does have a separate ac charger and cord type, but you can charge it via the USB (not as fast) too.
R3PXVXPCHAWW2	1.0	Broke in two months	1	1	Two months of use and it is completely broken after it was dropped once, on carpet, by my 2 year old. Not very durable if it breaks like that, so easily! I thought it was cheap before it broke due to screen lag and poor touchscreen sensitivity, but to break despite the protective cover, after falling on carpet nonetheless, is pitifully cheap. I hope I can get a refund :/
R3NPN2QZX48W0M	1.0	Mad !!!!	3	4	This item I purchased isn't working anymore nor is the charger working ! What is it I need to do for another tablet and charger haven't had long enough for it to not be working at all ! Need it replaced immediately or money back ! Hope that play station 4 I ordered works and doesn't stop or you can keep that and give Myy $428 dollars back for it too ! I am very upset with this purchase !
R21M3X4LPOPCKK	3.0	so am disappointed.	1	1	The tablet itself is decent for what you pay for. The preloaded apps DO NOT work, have yet to access them and we have had the tablet for 2 weeks. Looked into the problem and found this was the case with many other customers. As a basic tablet it functions fairly well, but I purchased this for the educational preloaded apps as advertised, so am disappointed.
R2H4TPR5NUDEO5	5.0	Very happy with this product	3	4	Very happy with this product. It was a great price and easy to set up and use. This was perfect for my family and I didn't have to stress about letting my son take it to a friends house and it getting broken and me being out a ton of money. So far everything has worked great. We also love the pre-loaded games on this one. I love how I can track my son's progress.
R34MLJ505CFR4X	3.0	Not what i expected but definitely not disappointed	1	1	I purchased this for my 6 year old daughter my and after letting it charge and set it up The screen went completely white within 2 hours of her enjoying it. I also purchased one for my son that one is fine so I ordered a new one for my daughter giving them a second chance because the other one is working ok the only con is the barttery life
R35RRA0IMCA61R	4.0	So I am happy with it	2	2	My son likes it. He is 6. So I am happy with it.
R2IRL0PFX100FS	4.0	Put a screen saver on it!!!	1	1	The screen has become very scratched from normal use by a 9 year old. Must be plastic(?) Other than that, it has been okay. The screen is not very bright when in daylight, okay in darker areas. The Zoodle never did work, but didn't really keep us from using it. Wish I had put a screen saver on it!
R1NV3UGUO3GU2X	3.0	Amazon was great with a quick replacement	1	1	OK unit. My son loves it. Had to have unit replaced within 45 days as the sound stopped working. Amazon was great with a quick replacement. Now need to see if we can replace the other one we purchased for our daughter as now the Power button stopped working (within 12 weeks). You get what you pay for.
R1LWFWUVDQ7MMT	3.0	ripped green silicone case and gash on case on opposite corner!	1	1	I just received this tablet today, it does seem to work but I went to put the case on it and put it back in box as its an Xmas gift for our son and there was a tare in the left top hand corner and a gash on the bottom right corner! For the price and for how long it took to get here, not happy with that!
R3G56YIZ16BHGC	3.0	Nice tablet for my 21 month old	1	1	Nice tablet for my 21 month old. The picture quality through the camer isn't very good at all. I also thought she could use the preloaded games on this w/out wifi. Which she can't. But after downloading apps myself it can be used not connected to wifi. But for the price it's good for her.
R2EBVX6130BNB7	1.0	Disappointed son	1	1	Received this tablet and had no problems. My son came to me yesterday and showed me that the on/off button is broken. He pressed the button to turn it on and it went down inside the tablet. He bought it on August 4 with the money his grandmother gave him. So after 2 months, it is useless.
R395T8MNJC8CO4	4.0	... year old and so far he has seemed to like it, other than it does not hold charge ...	1	1	I ordered this product for my six year old and so far he has seemed to like it, other than it does not hold charge for very long. I charged it to 100% and took it to school with me. Did not use it all day and that afternoon, I went to turn it on and it was completely dead.
R35KW28P033PG3	3.0	tablet great battery Not!!!	15	22	as far as the tablets ability to function well it does the job perfectly. as far as battery life that's another story. it takes hours and hours and hours to charge and does not last very long at all. because it was for my 7 year old I am ok with the purchase itself but if it would have been for any other things I would not recommend this
R1Y2V81K8CK9OT	3.0	For $60 it's ok	1	1	Brought for my 4 yr old. Great with downloading and connecting to wifi but it dies very fast in my opinion ,within 4 hours on continuous use then it Takes about 2 hours to charge back up. Also volume is very low had to buy head phones I order to hear.
R3DJ92CVFXW6LW	3.0	Somewhat disappointed	0	0	Pros: The tablet comes with a very heavy duty silicone case to protect it from bumps and falls. It also allows a parent to set up the tablet as the "owner" and then set up a second account for a child to use in which you can restrict the child's access to certain apps (i.e. Google Play Store, the Google account's email, etc.). The tablet has a great volume range (sometimes too good if multiple children are blaring the volume, lol) and is easy to navigate. It does have WiFi and Bluetooth, which are both nice features and will run almost any Android compatible applications. Due to its smaller size, it is very portable which is great for the kids to take in the car. This tablet is also typically user friendly, but more on that below. Cons: The battery life on these tablets leave much to be desired--at most, my kids get 4 or 5 hours of unplugged play. Additionally, the charger for these tablets is an AC/DC adapter instead of a USB or Micro-USB which means that if you are going to take a long car trip, you cannot just use a phone charger--you will need to buy another adapter. Another draw back is that even though the tablet comes with the nice protective case, it does not come with a screen protector. Since these tablets are marketed to be for kids, they should have a screen protector include to protect them from scratches and sticky fingers! The screen has to be wiped down daily and after less than a day of play, my kids' tablets could have been considered to have been "noticeably used." Also, the hard drive is fairly small and there is obviously no option for mobile data usage without a special device, therefore, movies are not much of an option when you are not on WiFi. My final con is that although the tablet claims to have a quad core processor and a newer version of the Android OS, at times, the tablet is slow to respond and it locks up more frequently than I would like to see. Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend with a young child--age 3 to possibly 8 would probably be fine with this tablet's capabilities. I would not recommend it for an older child.
R1BZO9XMHVW4LZ	3.0	Budget device but frustrating to use	0	0	Having reviewed on Amazon for a while, I was pleased to be receive this tablet computer for free in return for an independent assessment. I’ll concentrate less on the technical jargon and numbers and more on the experience. After all, it doesn’t matter if it has a “Quad Core 32 bit processor with 8 gigabytes of storage” if it doesn’t work very well. Before I start, lets put this in context. For the price of a Nexus 7 or iPad mini, you could buy several of these tablets, and still have enough money left for a massive 32Gb SD card. You’re looking at the “value” end of the spectrum, but the real question - is it any good? While you could compare devices based purely by specification (eg. 16Gb of storage is double the 8Gb size), it’s often quite a subjective area. For example, how do you assess “sound quality” produced from a tablet computer. I’ve therefore given this device a percentage score in a series of categories. * 100% means I think it’s just fantastic. The best you can buy. For example an iPad Air 2 (costing ten times the price) would for example get 100% for design and build quality. * 50% means I think it’s great - about average. So here goes…. *** Overall Design *** 80% *** Clearly this is aimed as a first tablet computer for a child, and that’s reflected in the child friendly packaging. Opening it up, you’ll find a standard sized 7” tablet computer, a thick rubber case to protect it, and a wall transformer and micro-USB cable to charge the device. It also comes with a short user guide which is surprisingly good, including photos and screen shots to illustrate the basics on how to get to going. Clearly this device gets bonus points for the thick foam case which gives lots of protection. It’s light and small enough for “little hands”, and has survived some heavy handed use by my 3 year old granddaughter. *** Screen *** 60% *** As with most budget tablets, the screen is plastic rather than the “Gorilla Glass” of the Nexus, and there’s noticeable screen reflection - so you won’t be able to use this in bright sun-light - but that’s not uncommon. While the 1024 x 600 screen resolution was acceptable, colours were decidedly muted, even with the brightness turned up to maximum which is likely to drain the battery. I also found there was a significant lag (often up to 2 seconds) when the device was switched from portrait to landscape mode which I personally found irritating, and I’m sure a child would quickly tire of. *** Sound Quality *** 40% *** Sound quality wasn’t brilliant (again as you’d expect at this price), and unfortunately it doesn’t come with a bluetooth connection. This is a major issue for me, as I often listen to music on these devices connected to a bluetooth speaker. It also means you can’t connect a bluetooth keyboard, or in fact any wireless device. You’re limited to using a pair of wired headphones (none-supplied), and sound quality was OK but way too quiet to listen to anything in a noisy environment. *** Cameras *** 40% *** As you’d expect there’s a front and rear facing camera (although details were not provided), so you can take snaps or video, or use it for Skype. Again, quality was not brilliant, and in fact colours were really muted - almost sepia in colour despite being shot in bright sun-light. Video likewise was very poor quality even outdoors. *** Web Browsing *** 40% *** I quickly connected it to Google and my photos, eMail and address book were immediately available. I then tested it on a few web pages including the image rich Daily Mail web site. While it’s unlikely your child will watch this web site, it’s an excellent test of the processor speed on what’s a fairly basic function - navigating web pages. Sorry to say, that while it scrolled up and down the screen pretty quickly there was a an awful delay in zooming into or out of web pages which is a real pity. I tried it on a few YouTube screens, and video played OK, although again, the delay between selecting a video and it playing was irritating, and sound very quiet. *** Game Playing *** 40% *** While I wouldn’t expect a device at this price point to run the most expensive, complex games, I do have one favourite “Air Wings” which has some basic 3D graphics, and runs on everything else. It’s a useful test, as I try it on every device, so can compare the experience. Again, sorry to say, the lag between tilting the screen, and the aircraft actually moving on screen made it really hard to use. My worry is a child would equally find it difficult, and just give up. *** Storage *** 90% *** In terms of storage it comes complete with 8Gb of space although not all of that is fully available, and I found out of the box there was about 7.7Gb left. Of course, you can always add a 32Gb Micro SD card for as little as £10.00 on Amazon which should be enough for most people to store books, videos and music. *** Battery Life *** 80% *** Finally, you should expect to charge this every day. I got about 3-4 hours out of it before I needed to charge it. Unusually, in addition to a standard micro-USB connection (to connect the tablet to a computer for backup), this device has a separate “pin” socket for charging, and it comes with the UK plug. *** Value for Money *** 90% *** In terms of value for money, this really is terrific. At the time of writing, this is one of the cheapest tablet computers on Amazon, and provided you take account of the limitations, it’s terrific value for money. So, OK, it doesn’t have a metal back and “gorilla glass” screen of an iPad mini - but it does almost everything an iPad can do at a fraction of the cost. *** Overall Conclusion *** 70% *** In conclusion, if you’ve never owned a tablet computer before, and want to dip your toe in the market, this is a functional (if rather limited) device - the lack of a a bluetooth connection is particularly poor. The screen and sound quality could be better, it could be a bit quicker switching from landscape to portrait, but you’re getting a usable tablet for little money. Technically, this is not a bad device. A 1.2 GHz processor and 8Gb of storage on a 7” tablet computer is certainly a good starting point. Even the lack of bluetooth and poor sound quality could be forgiven, although I’m less impressed by the muted screen colours both in use in photographs. For me, what really lets this down though, is the lack of responsiveness. A tablet is designed to be tilted from horizontal and vertical, and should be responsive in basic games. Likewise, the fact the screen doesn’t immediately respond to two finger zooming is a concern, although web sites and you tube display fine. My advice is if you only intend to use this for displaying video from BBC iPlayer, Amazon Instant Video or You Tube it’d be fine, but I think a child would become quickly frustrated if playing games on this. Having said that, it’s useable, and as long as you’re aware of the limitations it’s a good “starter” tablet computer.
R190ZIGJYSVAYV	4.0	First Impression of DRAGON TOUCH Kid's Tablet...	0	0	I purchased this tablet for my nephew's 4th birthday. He hasn't yet received it but I tested & played with the tablet for about a week and wanted to give my first impression of this device: First of all, the Dragon Touch tablet came very well packaged. All parts were present. The red case fit snuggly on the tablet. The A/C adapter worked great (though am a little perplexed why it wasn't a usb charger) Powering ON/OFF was as simple as any cell phone & the tablet loaded quickly. The USER MANUAL was a joke as it didn't even refer to this tablet whatsoever. Since I was planning to give the tablet to my technologically-impaired sister's child, I wrote out my own instructions to follow. I had to read another review to learn that the Parent Dashboard must be set up before you mess with the KID MODE at all. Might have been nice for the company to give that rather important info. The KID MODE is kinda cute. Mainly consists of kid-friendly You Tube videos, an basic art program, and books. There's only 1 FREE book that you can record yourself reading, anything after that, you have to get the subscription. Other games can be added to the KID MODE whilst in the Parent Dashboard. You choose from your list of installed apps and check the ones you want in the KID MODE. """""IMPORTANT"""" You MUST download Mozilla Firefox or Safari before setting up the KID MODE. You have to download Adobe Flash for some of the KM things to even show up. Luckily, they do provide a direct download link because good luck figuring out which version of Flash to get! But the direct download WILL NOT work with Chrome, the supplied browser. Go figure. Wi-Fi was easy to set up and quickly connected to my network. Internet browsing was fine for this device. Though I personally found the address bar hard to see as its rather Gray as opposed to white. Video quality is mediocre but a little kid under 7 probably won't complain. I REALLY had to keep reminding myself this was a $59 tablet because the display is not that good. I cranked the brightness all the way up and it wasn't as bright as my cheap a$$ cell phone.I messed around with the display settings, but nothing really improved the display quality. Again, a little kid won't mind as long as there's no bright sun to contend with. There's only one speaker, so sound isn't superb. I personally couldn't get my headphones to fit into the jack without removing the case but they did work. My headphones have a little upside down L shape near the plug in and it really needs a straight end in order to work with the case on. The games I downloaded for my nephew seem to run well. There'd only 5 GB space available on the device itself but you can add up to a 32 GB micro SD card. I personally have never had any luck getting apps to load onto a memory card, so I can't vouch for that capability with this tablet. It was easy enough to uninstall the apps I decided not to use. All in all, I was fairly impressed with this tablet, considering it was so cheap. I just hope it can withstand the paces my nephew is sure to put it through. Glad I bought some screen protectors and will recommend that the micro SD port be taped since its wide open and a card could easily be lost. Hope this helps & my spelling / typing isn't completely atrocious :)
R1SVFSL2GG4J6J	5.0	Great Tablet for Kids at a Great Price!	0	0	We have 3 girls and have gone through MANY tablets in the last 5 years. We always stay under $100 because kids will be kids and things get used, abused, and often broken. I was very impressed with this tablet and really liked how it was completely geared toward kids, even the packaging was impressive. We had no issues in setting it up and were connected to our wi-fi within minutes. So, I am not really sure what other past reviewers were experiencing. The only delay we had was a short wait while everything updated to all the current programming once we connected to the wi-fi. My daughter was using the tablet, after we fully charged it, within 15 minutes of my husband turning it on and starting the set-up. The case is awesome, and no it won't save the tablet if it is thrown from a second story window onto a concrete driveway, but for the normal oops drops that can crack screens (which we have experienced twice) the rubber case will definitely protect the tablet. We did look at a few other tablets geared toward kids, but ultimately chose the Dragon Touch due to it's quad core processor. My daughter mostly watches videos through Hulu and YouTube and there are no problems with lag, which had been an issue on her old dual core processor tablet. So, this is a really good choice if video and gaming speeds are important for your purposes. We haven't really explored the games all that much yet, so I can't really comment on those, but from first glance I am happy with the content and the ability to customize the difficulty levels based on age and grade level. We purchased this tablet to replace one that we bought last November that was accidentally dropped on our hardwood floors which resulted in the screen cracking so badly it no longer responds to touch. We purchased 2 of those tablets and only needed to replace 1 of them. My 9 year old is now very envious of her sister's new tablet and told me when she breaks hers she wants the same one, only in blue. I have a feeling we will be experiencing an accident occurring very soon that will require another Dragon Touch Kids Tablet being purchased as the replacement. Overall, we are very happy with the purchase and impressed with the quality based on the price. I really didn't expect to find a tablet with such nice and kid friendly features at such a reasonable price.
R15BE85IVOL51C	4.0	It's no Nexus 7...BUT it's also much less expensive	0	0	 Please note: I received a free sample for evaluation and review. I apologize in advance for the length of the video that is almost 10 minutes long, and I'll summarize the highlights of my impressions below to save you some time. The video shows off the hardware and software and will hopefully help you in your shopping if you're seriously considering buying this. Here's my bottom line - you don't pay much, and you get what you pay for. Take that how you want. :) It's a $60 tablet after all. I think that it's actually pretty good for the money, especially for young kids, but I want to help manage your expectations. Don't order this thinking that you're saving money because it's not a well-known brand name. You're saving money because it's a nicely designed tablet filled with lower end hardware. And you know what? That might be exactly what you want. I don't have kids, but I have a buddy who's kids (well, one in particular) consistently destroys electronics. I mean - destroys. Mostly the screens. MacBook Airs, iPhones, iPads...none survive. So, if your kids are like that, something like this might be a great choice. Well, or a box of crayons and blank paper. :D Sometimes, you should go old school. However, if you want to get your little wrecking ball a tablet, why not save some money in the process? Alright, here are the pluses that I've noticed: (*) Nice form factor and good feel to it - not too heavy, and not too light. It's like the Goldilocks of sizes for kids (*) GREAT cover, IMO. I love that thing. Comfortable, easy to grip, likely provides some protection (but I haven't hurled this at my brother...who also wrote a review, btw). Seriously - it's one nice cover (*) Comes with Android KitKat, and you can install any Android apps that you want (*) It comes with a "Kid Mode" for your kids that will lock them out of the normal functions, even if they try to reboot it (*) Decent speaker. Not great, but not too bad with the volume turned all of the way up...otherwise, it's pretty quiet (*) Despite no mention of it in the instruction, you can charge it via micro USB. I don't know why they even included a power adapter that most people will misplace. Just use one of the (I'm guessing) many cables that you already have for your phones/tablets to charge this up (*) It can help relieve your stress if your kid cracks the screen or throws it into a river, as compared to something more expensive (*) It might help your kids appreciate the more expensive tablets Some not-so-awesome aspects, which might not surprise you at this price point: (*) Off-axis viewing in one of the directions is atrocious. I'm not kidding. One might say that if a blind person was granted the gift of sight for the first time and opened their eyes to see this screen at an angle...it might be the most beautiful thing that they ever saw. Maybe. Darkness is close competition (*) Speed. Quad core or not, this certainly isn't the snappiest of tablets. That said, it's not horribly slow...but consider how patient your kids are (*) Whoever applied the included screen protector was either related to the owner of the factory or just generally didn't care at all. At all. Both my brother and I had pretty noticeable issues with those protectors. Mine had several dust particles (which cause bubbles) underneath. I just took it off...which brings me to the next point (*) The plastic (I'm pretty sure it's plastic) screen doesn't allow fingers to slide very well without that screen protector. So, if yours shows up as bad as mine, plan on buying another screen protector to put on it. Well, unless your kid destroys it first. :D (*) Battery life. Eeeee. Not a problem if your kid has ADD, but it's not going to last for hours like an iPad. I haven't pushed it to the limit, but it dropped over 10% in the time it took me to record the video. I had to charge it before the video because I had it in standby for about a day and it was totally out of juice. You probably want to grab a battery pack if you're taking a car trip or something (*) The cameras blow. Sure, they would seem like magic from someone from the 1500's. Okay, from the 1960's, even. Nowadays, though, they are below what I'd expect So, do I think it's worth it? That totally depends on what you want out of it. It's a decent tablet with some really basic software installed for your kids, but it's Android, so you can install any number of apps. If you want something cheap for your kids to play with - game on. If you're hoping to score a super tablet because it's an off-name brand...nope. It won't compete toe-to-toe with a higher-end tablet, but it's a LOT cheaper. A lot. That's the draw, and if that is attractive to you, then this could be a good option. I give it four stars because it's actually pretty cool for the price. If they were charging $100+, I'd bash them all day long. At $60 (currently), it's actually pretty good. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave me a comment and I'll respond as soon as I can. Thanks!
R15YOZQOHS7323	5.0	For parents who were disappointed with their child's innotabs this is a good alternative.	0	0	I just got the tablet today so this review is based on a limited experience. Pros: So far so good. It is very basic, but it does the job better than the innotabs I was looking to replace. This tablet will let you get on wifi, Google play and I was able to download plenty of apps including netflix for my kids. I haven't tried to surf the web, but I think that it should be doable. I like the bumper very much. The speed is pretty decent, this is coming from someone who tried the innotabs and I absolutely hate them. The price for this is great since it is similar in size to the kindle and it comes with a bumper. This tablet comes with a shipping screen protector that they tell you to remove (note:there should be two, one with wording on it and then one that I recommend you leave on), but I choose not to for extra protection and it works fine. I followed the directions and charged it for 10 hours before use. the battery life is not bad so far, its been about two hours and we are about halfway with continuous use. Now with the cons: The sound is not there. Why they put the speaker in the back is beyond me, but it is almost impossible to really enjoy the sound with this. I tried a standard set of headphones and I felt much better, but I'm not a big fan of kids using headphones. The picture quality is doable for preschoolers, but not an alternative to a more expensive tablet. The camera was not very bright, but the picture at least shows up. Overall, I recommend this for parents on a budget who need a basic tablet for kids to play games and watch netflix on. This is my experience so far and I will update if anything changes. By the way, I don't know how well it holds up to any throwing and or drops, so I would be careful. **Update** I loved this tablet for my children so much that I ordered another one that just arrived today! My oldest has even requested one in place of an i pad so I plan on a third. Got a chance to surf the web and it works good. Loads pages fast enough for me and my kids. I had some problems with wifi at first but discovered my router was to blame and not the tablet. My son threw it across the room and no cracks so far. I recommend this tablet. ***Update: August 2015*** I ordered a third tablet, works good like the other two. Definitely a good buy for all my kids aged 3,5 and 13.
R2IMG3SGX7DNTS	1.0	Bad slow.	1	1	Boooo hiss. Not sure if it's just ours but it is so slow after putting a few apps on its not even worth trying to open it. Price was right but quality sucked! Buy a Kindle with a guard for the kids to use. Much better idea, kicking myself now

RIA4F1623XXS	3.0	Gray lines all on one side of the display	1	1	I bought 2 for my kids, but one was unusable a month later due to a display issue. I'm working with support on it, so we'll see if they can resolve. I'd drop rating down considerably if they cannot fix or replace.

R2EXHKRZHBYKR	1.0	YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.....DISAPPOINTED!	0	0	Ok, I do not normally write reviews but need to vent about this "tablet" that I bought for our daughter. The first issue is the fact that you cannot use the kid app that came with the tablet. You need to update your adobe flash in order to play the games, so you follow the links to update only to get a message stating that your device cannot run adobe flash, not compatible. So, i get the tablet online so that my daughter can play disney junior games, only they will not load and the window closes itself. Then I try to download a couple of kids games through google play, same issue, cannot play anything besides fruit ninja. Try for netflix, which did manage to play without many freezing issues but could barely hear the show. Now the last and probably final straw... the battery SUCKS. I literally just unplugged the device (yes I charged it for a minimum of 10 hours, 2 times) and within 8 mins of just trying to work my way around the adobe fiasco, the battery was down to 93%. My daughter just tried for another 8 -10 mins to get a peppa the pig art app to load and now it is at 86%. So if you are able to get a game to work on this device, you will not be able to unplug it for more than an hour! Severely disappointed with this product and will be returning ASAP!!!! Oh, and the case is very cheaply constructed, it is not completely form fitting, it bubbles away from the screen along the one side.
R1M9UTNZZ6SRDH	1.0	horrible tablet! Only takes 2 days and the tablet ...	1	1	I bought one 1 month ago to send it to my daughter in my country..... horrible tablet! Only takes 2 days and the tablet wont turn on anymore. I Learned that I need to stay away from cheap electronics.
R14H97PZ8YZ28D	5.0	Perfect in Every Way :)	1	1	Works Great! Case and charger and everything came as it said, case fits perfectly, fully charged when it got here, and were happy we got this. Really good for kids, that's a definite :) (Zoodles app)
R2JCSAVLOSA2LJ	1.0	Horrible Product!	1	1	This item broke within two weeks of use by a five year old. The screen shattered when he touched it with his thumb. The company refused to exchange it for a new one. The 1 year warranty is useless.
RXIC6DNAE86NU	1.0	Expect to return it!	1	1	The touch screen is stopped responding after couple of use. I'm very disappointed! I had to returned it, and I bought a different brand name tablet for my 4 year old. Hopefully that's going to work.
R10V9KUVEJXGF4	5.0	The design is just awesome and the box is nice	0	0	Dragon Touch 7 just arrived hours ago and since, tonight, my daughter (3 years old) was very excited to play with. She was the one to open it and plug it into charge with my assistance. Now, she is just busy with it, learning and playing so I can focus on my office work. The design is just awesome and the box is nice. From everything that I have read, this is a good product and I have to say it because when something is good you have to say it. What I really like is the resistance of the tablet and the protection that comes with it for free. The high resolution display delivers crisp and clear content, making it a enjoyable experience for watching, reading or gaming. The Google Android 4.4 KitKat brings many more new features. Using the emoji icons, your conversations will be more interesting. The built-in Wi-Fi enables you stay connected on the go. With the dual camera, my daughter now can skype with her grandparents and there's more to share. This tabket is Great for kids--With Zoodles pre-installed. I just love this tablet, the best I purchased for my daughter. In other words, not too heavy, and not too light. It's like it was designed for all sizes for kids I definitely recommend parents to purchase this tablet. I will provide a video later to show the features I found on this great tablet. Don’t wait. !
RTEKDDD8XV4UF	5.0	Good buy, great price.	1	1	I ordered this tablet as a birthday gift for my son, who will turn 5 this weekend, and I am very pleased with the quality, especially the case, it feels very sturdy and like it will protect well.
R3CX1YY8YP75TI	1.0	Read before buying	0	0	The ONLY appealing thing about this tablet is the price. Perhaps if details are not a concern for you, this might work for you. First, the quality of the screen is what you paid for for. It is bright and slightly white-washed like an over - exposed photo. You may say so what, my kid doesn't care but I promise, you will care. Looking at the screen is not a pleasant experience. It's pretty bad despite any available adjustments. Next, I nor Google nor Dragon customer service could guide me thru how to get a downloaded movie to play. It streams movies with a many buffering pauses over WiFi but I specifically bought this for a 2 week road trip and added a 32 gig SD card with hopes of downloading a small arsenal of movies and games to pacify our son during the long hours in the car. Sadly, I did not learn that this tablet can not play downloaded movies until the night before our trip. Lastly, as far as RAM goes, you are getting the speed of a $59 tablet. I did not expect a miracle but I thought I'd take a chance to save a few bucks but now I'm back to square one with the hassle of returning this and purchasing something of, at the very least, acceptable quality. In a nutshell, if you just want something that lights up with a little sound, this is for you. If you even slightly appreciate quality, it's gonna cost you a few extra dollars.
REI7YDNUZ4FFQ	1.0	Seems a waste of money	1	1	I ordered 3 for grandkids. One quit working completely in time to exchange it, but then within 60 days two of them quit working, and I cannot exchange/return. Seems a waste of money...

R2R4I66QTQANOV	4.0	This is a great tablet for the price	7	10	This is a great tablet for the price. Perfect for a child. The case is a thick rubber. The screen is ok but gets that shadow look if your not looking straight on.
R3FP45P5Q6GHIA	4.0	Remember the Thing is Only $60!	0	0	I debated between 3 and 4 stars because on one hand this is a far from perfect tablet, but on the other hand we only paid $60! We bought this for our 3.5 year old daughter and we're mostly happy with it. Likes: Super kid friendly hardware, durable, and great size for little hands Zoodles app is okay (see dislikes) it is very easy for a kid to learn, my daughter had it down in less than 10 minutes Lots of apps available for kids, many of them free My daughter loves the recorded story books, it comes with one for free and it's pretty cheap to buy more Dislikes: The biggest one is Zoodles will just stop working sometimes dumping my daughter out into unmonitored, unfiltered, tablet land. I can't get Netflix to work within the Zoodles app (if anyone knows what I'm doing wrong I love to hear!) The power cord is really finicky there have been many times we thought we had it plugged in just to find it wasn't and the tablet was dead the next day. I wish instead of an app I could create a kid account on the computer so I wouldn't have issue one. All in all, it was worth the $60. I recommend getting the carrying case that Amazon recommends with it as well for safe travel.
R3U87MD0ZTWHJM	3.0	Fell far short of the investment. Even at this price.	0	0	Had a major problem with shipping on the item. That was more on Amazon's end not the seller, however when the tablet arrived I had a few issues. The tablet came with Zoodles, which I love and have used in the past. However it could not be opened without flash player. Of course I tried to download flash player and the tablet claimed it was unable to. That it did not support flash player. It took two hours and much Googling to finally force flash onto the tablet. The other main issue is the tablet has a charging problem. I don't know if it is the chord or the tablet but it charges only if it is a good mood and you wiggle the chord just so. Or not. I researched this as well and found many customers complained of the same issue. Yes I can return the item but after the shipping, the struggle to get flash on it and the frustration of not charging I decided to go to the store and buy my son a different tablet. In this case, you get what you pay for. It could have been a great buy for the money, the tablet has all the bells and whistles of a larger or even more expensive tablet, but if it is not equipped to run programs that are included with it or even able to charge, then it is just a 60 dollar paper weight.
ROGWFKW0AAYD6	2.0	Not set up for kids - kid version costs money.	0	0	I bought this for my daughter's birthday. Owning samsung tablets - I assumed this would be similar. I was wrong. This is not user friendly and does not have sufficient instructions on how to locate the pre-loaded, kid friendly apps. Once I located the 'kids version' I found that the app does NOT have the free games, books, and kid security as advertised. You must pay for all of the upgrades it should automatically have. If you want access to the books, games, and kid security you will need to buy a $5.00 monthly subscription to access them. I ended up spending hours downloading and locating them from the app store where I already have a subscription. When the screen is vertical, it is almost like things are in 3-D. It hurts the eyes. My daughter has stayed entertained with the games I have downloaded for her, however I am wishing I had purchased something else - perhaps the Amazon Kindle or Fire for kids; maybe even a 7" Samsung tablet. She wants to be able to read on this and I am going to have to spend more time researching and downloading books onto the kindle I had to install instead being able to use the advertised kids mode. I am pretty disappointed.
R32WA4B485Y6UC	1.0	My son is do disappointed. I bought a Neutab for my daughter and ...	1	1	Very slow device. It is not user friendly. I am still not able download any games. My son is do disappointed. I bought a Neutab for my daughter and it is so much better.
R1OZC5WGMEEH3W	4.0	Great for 1st Grader's homework & screentime needs. Sturdy enough to handle his clumsiness	0	0	Basic tablet with the same app functions as a high end but a great price for those who don't need anything fancy. Camera leaves much to be desired, and the battery life could he better. But because I bought this for my son to use for homework or his allotted screen time each day, this isn't the biggest deal. The case is great. This thing has been dropped a couple times and it has enough cushion around it and in the front that, unless you drop it on sharp rocks or 10' up, it can withstand basic kid "oops" moments. Primary uses have been games, including his ST Math game from school, youtube videos, and Netflix. Skype a couple times but it does have lag so he found it to be more annoying than fun, so can Skype grandma from my phone or Kindle from now on. Streaming videos do experience some minor lag, but after a few seconds it's good to go. All in all, I am happy. He can do homework on his tablet or watch a show, and I can keep my Kindle for myself. We have had it for 3 months now, and I am pleased. 1 star docked for an incredibly bad camera. But it isn't a deal breaker since we have multiple devices he can take a random picture from.
R3OT74L9T2P4C5	2.0	Not a good product: cheap and unreliable	0	0	We had high hopes, but we disappojtned. It is very inexpensive-- the price was the deciding factor in purchasing this. But there were way too many drawbacks: 1. The screen scratches way too easily. After two days' use, it looked like the back of a ten-year-old compact disc. 2. It's processing power gives out often. Games froze and the whole tablet did a few times too. I had only installe a couple of kids games. 3. The display is sub par. It's not bright or crisp at all 4. I couldn't use it while charging. Maybe this was just mine, but it would go berserk while plugged into a power source. 5. Related to 4, it had about 2 hours battery time, but would take about 6 hours to fully charge. On a road trip with a kid, this ratio was unacceptable, unless he could use it while charging. :( 6. Well, we don't have to deal with it anymore because after one month the screen cracked. Badly. I bought a Kindle Fire to replace it. The kindle was less expensive ($50) compared to the $70 I paid for this. The Fire is much sturdier, faster, and more reliable. Hopefully this review saves you $70.
R10DWG64UYFVZV	1.0	Does not work with Amazon well	0	0	We purchased this item based on the description and reviews. Unfortunately it didn't meet our needs. We even paid for expedited shipping to have it for a road trip. It does not allow you to download purchased videos from Amazon. This was frustrating but not the kicker since we hadn't purchased what we wanted yet. We were just going to purchase them elsewhere. The volume is very low. This might be great for some parents but if you want it to play videos on a road trip for your toddler, this is not loud enough. At its loudest setting, it was barely audible over other ambient noise. It was very slow, even right out of the box before loading it with apps, videos, etc. The screen is awful and is only works well if you are looking directly at the flat screen. Any tilting of the screen washes out the screen almost completely. We had pretty low expectations knowing we were buying a budget tablet but even then it was a very disappointing product. We returned it. Don't waste your money. Just go ahead spend the extra for a better product. This one isn't worth the headache. You WILL be disappointed.

R3G0HA212VRGX	5.0	I don't think you can beat the price for a great child's tablet!	0	0	Purchased this for my niece as a 9th birthday gift. I read & read about it and felt it was a great choice to see how she does with it before entertaining the idea of giving her a substantially more expensive electronic device. I was pleased when she opened it, the protective cover is quite good, not the flimsy p,asti I rather expected for the price. And I thought overall the contents were also stellar for the money, it was packaged like a good quality device, not just wrapped up & boxed with a flier the way some of the more "affordable" electronics arrive. I have not had a chance to play with it myself yet though, she LOVES it! As much as I live to give gifts that have this very effect, I was hoping to spend a bit of time on it to see if it would also be a good choice for my special needs son who's DVD players never seem to last more than 6 months for his movies as well as (fingers crossed) potentially some other activities & games that he may enjoy. Ah, well, I am sure she will give me a turn eventually :-) Both she & her mom are very, very happy with it.
R2W9UVA9M473LX	1.0	Rotten to the Quad Core	0	0	Bought this for a child, and it worked okay for about 5 months. Then it became stuck in a boot loop and would longer function. As best I can tell the firmware has become corrupt. The tablet could probably be reflashed, but the tools and instructions for reflashing provided by Tablet Express are pretty much unusable / incomprehensible. (Note to Tablet Express: Only hit the "Translate" button on Google Translate once. Doing it six of seven times can render the original text into gibberish) Considering that I routinely upgrade/replace the firmware of routers and phones, this is not a small achievement. Tablet Express should be congratulated for figuring out how to design a tablet that survives through the warranty period and then immediately craps out. The larger problem with this tablet is that if it had at least the decency to completely stop working, I would have chucked it and moved on. Instead I'm going to dragging this POS out every few weeks to try out some new scheme for repairing it. Damn you Tablet Express... damn you all to hell!
R2T51QLKHJMSPH	1.0	Dead Tablet !!	0	0	All excitement about this tablet vanished as the device would NOT TURN ON from the very first moment it came out of the box... even though at plugging the charger, battery level was at 2/3rd and the Charging for about an hour the battery showed 100% charge... still WON'T TURN ON... It was such a DISAPPOINTMENT since kids were so excited for their first own tablet... so we plugged in the charger all night... but again.. NO sign of LIFE after charging even for 10 hours(suggested on the label ;) )... I simply don't get it...how can you send a device before checking it's basic functions at least?? Trying to reach the Customer Service through Email & Phone... some how Phone number always sends to Voice mail... Got response from 'em only through Email... seeking the Serial Number from the rear of the device. Will see how it goes from here. Will update the review after the responses & resolution.... as of right now 1 star.. for the DEAD device. Calling the Cust. Serv. # 301-670-7335.. Machine answers.. Answer machine is full... (So you're out of luck on getting live help ) :(.

R2CORQBSSWR20Z	1.0	Very, very, very disappointed...	0	0	I purchased one of these tablets a few months ago and for the 3 days I used it after receiving it I liked it quite a bit for the price. But it's true, you get what you pay for, after the first few days I was unable to get it to turn on as if it had a completely dead/drained battery and it could be on the charger for any length of time (days,hours,minutes,etc) it did not matter, it would not turn on. I requested an exchange of the product and sure enough not even a week after receiving it I experienced the same issue with the supposedly "new" tablet. I tried returning them both but they wouldn't let me so I sent back one of the tablets but they sent it back so I sent it once again forced to still keep one of the tablets even though neither of them worked. Then my credit card was charged for the broken "replacement" that was sent back. So now after sending back the original tablet, Im still stuck with the other broken one that was only used and working for a few days and my credit card has yet to be credited for the one I was able to send back.

R3LGX9G41M4FJP	4.0	Pretty decent tablet for the price	0	0	Pretty decent tablet for the price...I bought 2...I haven't used the zoodles though...my kids just use it to watch youtube videos & play games that they downloaded from the google play store and it works great for that...they're 4 & 6 so they don't need it for much which is why it works fine for me...I particularly like it because if they drop/lose it, I won't feel as if it were a giant loss... Negatives: the cameras are of a poor quality but as I said before, my kids are too young to care/mind...the case makes charging a bit annoying because it's difficult to tell if the jack is inserted properly (so either an adult has to put it to charge or - as my resourceful 4 yr. old has figured - you have to take off the case a bit)...the battery life isn't good...I swear it seems likes it's going down a percent a minute but if you charge it over night, it's good sat. morning entertainment then you can let it charge at lunch and use it in the afternoon and so on...if anyone can tell me how to optimize the battery, I'd appreciate it...
R2W3CHBTSTAT0G	5.0	Needs real games not youtube videos!	1	1	My 3 year old son really loves this tablet. I do wish their was more games. The only game available on noodles are just youtube videos.
R8M8N4HVTM4YY	4.0	good kids tablet	0	0	I wanted to get my friends daughter a decent tablet for her second birthday. I looked into the leapad tablets and decided against them because of the price and the fact that my friend would have to by cartridges every time she wanted a new game. The tablet came earlier then expected and works very well. It does need to charge for 10 hours before first use so if it's a gift I recommend charging ahead of time. It seems to be pretty sturdy and is surprisingly light. The camera is a bit fuzzy but it's for a 2 year old so know big deal. I would give it 5 stars but it said it came with zoodles and it wont let us use it because it would let us download adobe flash player which is needed for the program to run. My friend and I spent nearly 30 minutes trying to get it figured out before we got frustrated and gave up. We did however friend many free apps from the google play store and her daughter loves them! Overall this is a great product and I'm very happy with my purchase. Despite a few flaws I would definitely recommend this kids tablet.
R1PAPY567PAP82	1.0	Good attempt, but spend a little more and do better.	0	0	So its a $60 dollar tablet mostly geared towards kids. The charging is via a non-microsd cable and it is difficult to insert properly when the case is on. The screen is subpar, 2 of the 4 we ordered chipped in the corner while removing the screen protector and the 3rd cracked while being played. The Zoodles app seems interesting, when it works, my guess is the limited hardware is impacting this. A prime example is when you attempt to watch a video (looks like they are embedded YouTube) it won't play and the kids are left staring at a screen that doesn't do anything or explain the issue. Otherwise some apps work, again focusing on kids, most of the games they want to play cannot run or crash due to the limited systems. Finally a note on battery life, the kids will setup camp next to your chargers, it doesn't last long at all.
R2D7F4ZY4EDYDZ	3.0	cheap tablet for older kids and adults, only the cover is toddler proof	0	0	bought this for my 2 yr old who loves to sneak her siblings ipods and our iphones but aside from watching Netflix she has little interest in this tablet. mostly because it is always dead. the battery dies extremely quickly! the touch screen is often hard to use and the preloaded zoodles is a joke. it was mostly pbs videos and not toddler games and you had to pay to view them. weve installed a few games from google play but I have to load them into kid mode and I have to be the one to turn on the tablet and put it in kid mode before she can play. I wanted something she could play without me worrying about her getting on the internet or buying something, this is not the right tablet for that. it requires too much supervision. even in kid mode she can buy in app purchases from the games we installed. the cover is the only toddler proof thing about this tablet. for the most part its a cheap tablet in a good cover that I will probably start using for myself and get my 2 yr old the nabi jr I should've bought to begin with.

R3KUR4XV5T3AJA	1.0	Beware of the Misleading Amazon Reviews!!	0	0	I do not recommend the Dragon Touch tablet. I have been scouring the Internet hoping to find answers on how to fix my son's because it won't power on past the Android screen. Everything I've managed to find online (outside of Amazon) has been pretty abysmal reviews. The reviews on the Amazon website itself were pretty misleading. His birthday was in July, and we noticed problems almost immediately. He practically had to use the tablet while it was plugged in because the battery did not last very long (and he does not get to spend a ton of time using it either). We also had it in "kid mode" to prevent him from downloading a million game apps. He had a few on there, but it ran so slow you'd think he had free reign of the google Play store. We are past the return window now, and aren't under a warranty. My husband has it pulled apart and if he can't fix it we are just going to give it a Viking funeral or something. At least it wasn't too terribly expensive.
R2ROCQ4PPZLAPB	2.0	Not Worth The Time & Effort	0	0	I actually purchased two of these tablets for my kids. They each came set up in a different manner. They had different backgrounds and files on each. The Zoodles software was a joke since there is very little that you can access without paying for a premium service for $60+ a year. This software was falsely advertised. Furthermore in order to unlock it, you need to be able to download Adobe Flash player which is an out of market app but only one of the tablets would let me check the unknown sources button. I contacted the company about this issue and they sent me a link and told me to reinstall the firmware on the tablet. Unfortunately, they gave me no instructions even though they said to follow ones in their email which there were none. I have figured out that the necessary file(s) need to be obtained by manipulating the downloads on a PC but that's about it. Overall, the tablet set up and included apps are just not worth the time. I will be returning them.
R1ECKX0IP0I8FV	1.0	Spend more for a functioning tablet	0	0	Returned this within 2 hours of receiving it. Google Play doesn't function on it, it only tells you it's unable to connect. I connected this to my wifi and ensured the tablet had internet connectivity before anyone says I didn't do everything I should have. The time and date were automatically correct as I had internet connectivity, went to settings>apps>cleared cache and data on Google Play and Play services, still nothing. I cleared the cache partition and was close to rooting to get it working but then I stopped and said, "I shouldn't have to". I called the phone number for the manufacturer and without even ringing, the voicemail was full. That means their "customer service" is some person with a cell phone too dumb to check or clear his/her voicemail. The fact that this thing cannot download apps straight out of the box and the lack of professionalism from the manufacturer I just gave up and decided to return it. All within 2 hours of owning this tablet ***Update*** The manufacturer did try and fix my issue. That is great and all but the problem is they seem to send their "support" emails at 3:00 am MDT (where I live). Apparently, depending on the serial number, there needs to be a firmware update to get the Google Play app to work. Try that if it isn't working. I still stand by my review and went with a Digiland tablet which I highly recommend over Dragon Touch. Digiland has a great quad core processor that more than keeps up with my toddler, the viewing angles are so much better and best all the apps work right out of the gate.
R1X7G2B3I6PEZT	2.0	Horrible screen, good protection	0	0	Is it ok to make your kid's eyes suffer simply because they probably won't really notice it? The resolution is very low, everything is a bit blurry and a bit pixelated. If you move the tablet slightly - more than say 5 degrees from directly facing your eyes - the colors will go black. (So if you thought your two kids would be able to share it while watching a show together - forget it). It's reasonably not super-slow, kinda ok (it makes me laugh when some users start comparing it to their high-end phones and say "this is actually quicker" - what a lie. But it's usable. Again, keeping in mind your kids would be using it (since an adult would throw it into trash immediately with this resolution), they will probably not mind wait a few extra seconds for stuff to load. One department it shines in - the rubber protection. Wow, it's so good. Non-slippery, nice to touch, very protective and very surprisingly easy to use all the controls.
R2WYW6G64F1XJX	4.0	Dragon Touch tablet is perfect starter for one year old!	0	0	The Dragon Touch is a great product which my 15 mo. grandson has already elevated to his top group of activities. The structure is there for a "kid only" mode with a PIN password to enter or leave the kid-mode, initial app's for toddler, and app management feature to add apps to the kid-mode --- though flexibility in PIN selection, no-cost initial app's, and an easy app management tool are sadly missing. I still have not found how to change from centigrade to Fahrenheit or change some of the OS setting toggles (and geo-location was difficult to find) --- an on-line help file would be useful, the enclosed fold-out guide does not match the tablet. And probably the easiest improvement would be to pre-install the impact-protection silicone-gel cover so that little boys don't throw the unprotected tablet on the hard floor while opening their new present. Overall, a great buy for the kid with some frustration for the adult that can easily be fixed.
R10JW5N0H3KIPH	4.0	This tablet is great if you have a 3+ yr old and wanted ...	0	0	This tablet is great if you have a 3+ yr old and wanted to start learning games and phonics. I have a Samsung tablet and in comparing it, the dragon touch 7 is great for children. The display is not as clear as mine. The start up of the (OS) operating system is slower than mine. The camera is not as good both the front and rear cameras. But thats fine for me being that my youngest is just starting out. As for durability, the lil one has thrown this tablet up against the wall and I was sure it was done for. It is as durable as stated. I checked it out and not a scrach, crack or glitch. Still, you must exercise caution with the handling. My youngest never uses it outdoors. But I am impressed with the operation, the games for kids are good and it can load videos for road trips. Battery life is better than i expected too. So if your looking for a tablet for a child under 4 yrs old I would say this is a great choice for the money.
R2XESSAAWY5B8G	2.0	good at first..	0	0	This tablet was perfect for my 3 year old At first, But then it got weird. It first started off with a weird blue tint on the screen. My son thought it was a "brightness" issue so he was looking for a brightness setting when there even wasn't one. So he ignored it and continued using it. Then it started glitching. They were some type of red glitches. They weren't a huge deal so again, we ignored it considering the fact that it was a cheap tablet. THEN the battery died, ok no biggie, charged ot overnight, but it wouldn't turn back on AT ALL. Contacted the seller, was going to send it for repair because it only lasted TWO weeks. Decided to return it instead. I didn't want to take the chance of having to return it if something else broke. I was a bit disappointed because he really loved this tablet, we literally took great care of it, it had no pictures and only 3 apps. So I now will spend extra few bucks for a better tablet

R355RGSC1ZZSMH	3.0	FALSE ADVERTISING!!!	0	0	I purchased 3 of these in one order for my granchildren. On one of them, the charging cable looked different than the other two, and it didn't even fit, so was useless. These tablets boast about having Zoodles preinstalled, which was a selling point for me. But when I tried to use the Zoodles app, it said you needed to download Flash Player. When I clicked on the link they gave to do this, a message comes up saying that this device doesn't support Flash Player. I tried every way imaginable to install it; no luck. So, the Zoodles app is not at all accessible. This is absolutely false advertising. I called the company, and a pre-recorded message said they will TRY to get back to me in a day or two. This is not acceptable to me as I need them for birthdays which are in 2 days,and I am very, very disappointed as I really was looking forward to giving these to me grandchildren. UPDATE: I have spent the last few weeks contacting the company that made these. I must say, they have been very helpful in resolving some of the issues, such as how to install Flash Player. It would have been nice if they would have included these instructions with the product, as it was pretty detailed. Other issues have cropped up, such as one of the AC adapters didn't fit. They did send a new one. One of the three I ordered was able to do some things that the other two couldn't, such as saving the apps to the memory card instead of the device. Don't know why they were different...all were supposed to be identical. Anyway, customer service from this company did their best to resolve my issues. It just took a lot of time and required computer savvy, which was not a problem for me, but someone else might not have been able to do it all.

R31TZSJ6LQTURG	1.0	Be sure to buy the warranty! I didn't.	0	0	After EXACTLY 30 days of use, the screen just displays as white. There is occasionally some sound as if the OS is running. I called 2 times now for support, and they force you to leave a message on an old style answering machine. I'll update this post with any new response that I do get. All of that said, as a tablet, and a $60 one at that... It's fine for kids, but the screen (when it did work) isn't very bright. The system is responsive enough for kid apps, but it does take some time to load Zoodles for example. There is a noticible pause when I've used it to set things up for my 5 year old. It doesn't compare to the Galaxy Tab 3 that my daughter has, but for 5 - 7 year old's it is fine. Assuming that it continues to work more than 30 days. I wish I would have gotten the Squaretrade warranty for it, so I could just go through them.
R1QI42KY0ZOU1H	1.0	Waste of money.	0	0	I bought 2 of these for my 3 year olds a few months ago and they both broke in about a month. I bought 1 more after that in the hopes that the first 2 were just flukes. I'm an idiot. The third one just broke after about 2 months of very light use. The entire tablet just falls apart for no reason. The clips that hold it together break off and then they stop taking charge. They could only play with them while they were plugged in. Then something would go wrong with the screen and it would not register where you were touching it. My daughters loved these while they lasted but now I have to explain to them that they are gone. Mommy wasted her money on crap tablets and I am so sorry. They offer you a free gift if you give a 5 star review. That is why you are seeing such a high rating for this product. Don't be fooled like I was. Buy something else.

R2YS8VL738GO91	5.0	60 dollars well soent	0	0	Well I purchased this tablet after my daughter dropped and destroyed her nexus 7 tablet. I was hesitant to purchase a cheaper tablet. But once it arrived on a Sunday I was extremely impressed with what 60 dollars got me.I mean the reviews about the camera accurate. But my daughter is 3 and loves that she can take pics both ways so no issues for me. The screen not as bad as thought. Of course its not 300 dollar tablet quality but it does the job.and it came with a screen protector on it. The ram is a bit of a bummer but for the price again works just fine. The reviews about zoodles not accurate at least for my tablet it works amazing other than the fact you have to pay monthly to get full use.I like that the free apps can be used on it. My daughter is a happy camper now. Im thinking about purchasing a few for my nieces and nephews
R39DV5185K49GF	1.0	Invest your money elsewhere	0	0	Do not buy this, I would invest in something else for the same price. I ordered two, and both came with different charging adapters. That tells you something about what they throw in each box. Then one of them would never fully charge even after the 10 first full hours. The one that fully charged would not download apps correctly and it get restarting. Overall, super bad experience, the case looks cute but it is just like a .99 cents silicone gel phone case cover if you drop it you will still get damage to your phone. Turn away from this product do not let it fool you. I am sure the good reviews are the very few tablets that maybe worked at the beginning but by now they are not lasting at all. We returned both of these thanks to Amazon Prime and did not waste our $60 (twice) for two different yet "same" tablets.
R5SD2IFJXXXZG	2.0	"It's annoying."	0	0	I purchased this Android mainly for my son ( my girls have Leapads) who is 2 1/2. We had plans to travel and I wanted him to have this for the plane ride. Unfortunately, the WiFi on the airplane was awful and he could not watch videos or play most of the games that I had previously downloaded for him. For this reason alone, I wish I had gone with another leapad. The WiFi problem was not the fault of the device but in my daughter's words, "This thing is annoying." You have to constantly press down aggressively on the key(s) when playing a game because the keys constantly freeze. I find myself rebooting all the time. My son lost interest from day one and he gets flustered when the keys freeze (with good reason). The price was decent but hey you get what you pay for. I just want my cell phone back!
RAB3LA3REUAYS	3.0	My older child likes her sister's Samsung better, but plays with this one as well	0	0	For a child's tablet for the price, it is just ok. My three complaints - battery life is less than satisfactory. It runs down fairly quickly. The other issue I had was playing movies. It would allow me to buy and download, but would not play it ever. And after googling and researching as much as I could, I still could not find the answer as to why or how to change it. And lastly there is no home button, physical button. I didn't think it was an issue at first but sometimes if an app stops, getting the app to close with an actual button to push can be a pain. I bought my second child a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.0 7 inch. Comparing the two, hands down the Samsung wins. Battery life is much longer, has the kid mode that you can enable (as well as a parental mode so an adult could use it for their purposes as well), and easier to operate. And it has a physical home button. It is also lighter in weight and screen quality is way superior. My older child likes her sister's Samsung better, but plays with this Dragon Touch as well. I will let her use this one for a while and then upgrade my first child to the Samsung. The $70 difference in price is worth it in my opinion.

I'm currently writing this review because I am currently searching for a new tablet for my daughter. We purchased the Dragon Touch 7" Quad Core tablet for our 3 year old and she loved it. The volume was a bit low and the battery life was a bit short but it served it's purpose well. Well, literally a week after we bought it, we were getting ready for bed. I threw my daughters favorite doll up on the bed with her and the slight tap of the plastic doll hand ruined the screen. Save your money and buy a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 or something, I have let her use mine for over two years while i wasn't using it and it has worked perfect. Save your money and don't buy this.... It isn't a gamble, it's a fact. It is cheaply built and it will break.
R3BF9F0URVW1T8	3.0	You get what you pay for	0	0	Purchased this as a starter tablet for my four year old son. So far after only having it a day, he loves it. Tons of learning apps as well as standard games he can play. The only things I have to complain about are that you seemingly cannot download flash player because it is not compatible with the device. You need flash to run the zoodles app that comes pre installed. Also there is already a line of dead pixels going across the entire screen. And then last, the tablet is so thin, if your fingers press too hard on the back of the tablet while it's being held, it causes ripples in the screen. All in all its not a bad tablet for $60. You get what you pay for. Wouldn't recommend for a child or adult that has experience with tablets, but it isn't a bad choice for beginners.
RZMWJOOTGCU6V	1.0	Broken with no sound	0	0	I ordered two of these tablets for my daughters. The first tablet we opened seemed fine. I charged it and downloaded some apps... After only a little bit of use the battery quickly started dying. After downloading a game app I opened it up for my daughter to play. No sound. I've checked all the settings and they all seem to be on and turned up. So, I proceeded to charge up tablet number 2 to see if it had the same problem. After opening I quickly realized the on/off button looks broken. I've try to contact the maker for help and so far have not been able to reach anyone. I then decided to email and the system seem to be too busy to receive my message. Unless I receive help or exchangs on the two tablets they will be returned! I was very dissapointed considering all the good reviews it has!
R282QTDA60075P	4.0	Excellent product for the price	0	0	Excellent product for the price. Little sluggish, camera pretty bad and viewing angle is poor (that is why I'm deducting one star). As many other users described, per-installed kids software is worthless but there are some free child lock apps in android store to replace it. Turned off developer mode right away. Battery is pretty good. The speakers are loud enough to watch a movie at home but for a car you'll need headphones. Both my kids (3&5) love it so far, but i didn't spend a fortune and in a year or so better newer model will come out anyway. I was debating btw Kids kindle and this and Dragon Touch won. For less than one 6-inch kindle you get two 7-inch Android Tablets that you can play anything on, not just amazon content (where Wi-Fi is required).
R2NC7DNG9B8RG5	2.0	This tablet seemed like it was a returned item that was shipped to ...	0	0	This tablet seemed like it was a returned item that was shipped to me. When I opened the package that both tablets came in, this tablet`s original box had the tape cut on the outer packaging and when I opened it I noticed that the cardboard piece that covered the charger and usb was not like the other tablet, which was a long rectangular cardboard sealed box. After charging the tablet for 10 hrs and doing the set up, the calibration on the tablet was off. We tried to reset the tablet but it froze. I was rather disappointed because I had purchased the two tablets for my grandchildren. I had one happy grandchild and one very frustrated one. The tablet that works is great and meet all my expectations. I am a little bummed that my granddaughter will have to wait another week or so to enjoy hers.
R19SMRC558YJZN	1.0	Never worked, asked for a return. Disappointed son	0	0	I bought this for my son's birthday. He was so excited when he opened it; he must've screamed and jumped around the house for 5 minutes. Then we opened the box. It said to charge for at least 10 hours before use so that was disappointment number one. The next day, after charging for 10 hours, the power button wouldn't work, it arrived to us in worthless condition already broken. We never were able to get it to turn on. Even my husband, who is extremely knowledgeable with technology, could not get it to turn on. I know there are thousands of reviews for this item, and I know the chances of getting a broken one is low. However, even though there are good and bad reviews, there are bad ones for a reason. I'd recommend a Kindle Fire. It's more money for a reason.... it's not a piece of junk.
R2C0IYAZWX9XBA	1.0	Don't buy	0	0	Bought this tablet for my daughter. She was super excited when it finally came. It comes lots of games that cannot be played because Adobe flash player is not installed. You have to go into the security settings and enable installation for unknown sources. OK sounds easy enough but when I check the box and click ok the Box UNCHECKS itself. So basically I have tried probably 50 times at this point to simply check the box and have it stay checked but it won't. My daughter is in tears because we have to send this tablet back. Will never buy any version of this tablet again. I am extremely frustrated at this point and I want my money back. Oh did I mention I paid for express shipping and the tablet arrived 2 days later than it was supposed to....?! Would give a negative star if I could.
R2TGFM3AS2HGFY	3.0	Nice Tablet, but the outer shell does not protect too well from drops....	0	0	This is my second tablet to buy in two months. The first one dropped and scrambled the screen, so I bought another one and within 3 days it too was dropped (4 yr old granddaughter) and it got several cracks throughout the screen. The reviews I read stated that the shell around it did a good job of protecting it from drops.......it did not work in either one of these cases, which is the whole reason I purchased this particular product was for it's thick rubbery outer layer......Needless to say, it will be a while before she gets another tablet. She is very hyper (ADHD) and is constantly stumbling or tripping, but she loved playing on her tablet and could keep her entertained for a quite a while......The quality itself is good, it's just not protected enough for take a decent fall..
R3MM60I15LKTZO	4.0	Awesome better then smartab	0	0	First off let me just say that this tablet is way better then the smartab i previously bought that stop taking a charge after about a month and i had to send it back. It has veey decent parental controls and you can even record the screen to see if your lil one is actually doin what you topd them to do and not just playin around because yes this is an andriod tablet but it is a kids tablet and its set up just like one with zoodles n all . Overall i would recommend this to anybody who is tablet searching for a child shipping was quick but i think thats because it cane from cali and i live in vegas. Reason i rate it a four star is because the battery life is horrible charge it up to 100% and take it off to play with and in about 10 mins its on 50% other then that wonderful tablet .

The Skin Fits Perfectly to the tablet and so far it seems to be a nice little tablet that I can use along with my it's main purpose a gift for for 6 year old. I read a Lot of reviews comparing tablets for kids and I went with this compared to the Kindle. The price is unbeatable and a Lot of adults/teen use this tablet and love it. I figured to give it a try and got rid of the Pre-installed kids programs because of some of the ratings and used google play and uploaded amazon along with a Parental Controlled program for my children to use Safely on the Tablet! It takes a Little to get used to just like any New Tablet or Phone but for my money's worth, I Love it and can see that I will be buying a second one in the near future!
R2AONXJFFXBTRL	5.0	So far so good!	0	0	I just received this today and so far I love it! It came with 79% battery life, I only turned it on to make sure it worked before taking off stickers, I then turned it off and charged it to 100% (it didn't take too long, I should've checked the time sorry.) It came with the screen protector already applied and the case was in the box, it is rubber and very easy to apply! The screen is sharp and nice to look at, the touchscreen is very responsive and the sound is great! Zoodles is preinstalled, you have to install Adobe flash for it to work, unfortunately, the zoodles site was down for maintenance so I have yet to check it out. Adobe would not download until I opened the apps and updated zoodles, then I had no problem installing Adobe! I'll update my review as I use it more!

R3HR73ZDYIJWW3	2.0	If the first one doesn't work properly ask for a refund than buy a new item again.	0	0	The first tablet I received worked for a few days then the screen stopped working. I had this item replaced with a new one, so I thought. When I received the "new" one", it was worst than the first one. This time the tablet did not come on at all or if it did the screen was so black that I could not make neither head nor tail. I believed that instead of a brand new item they sent me a refurbished item and that's NOT what I paid for. I just sent this tablet back on today questing a full refund. My Grandson was sitting patiently waiting for absolutely nothing. He was very upset to say the least. The only reason I am giving this item 2 stars instead of one is because I believe that if it worked properly it would be a good investment.
RJG3A1XNGY5VF	1.0	Do NOT buy this tablet!!!!!	0	0	This tablet was shipped to us on September 1, 2015. We purchased it for our 5 year old son and we (parents) are the only ones responsible for keeping up with the device when it is not in use. The device suddenly stopped holding a charge after about 2 weeks and now on Oct 12th, it has completely STOPPED working. This tablet is advertised as a child's tablet but is simply a cheap tablet with a plastic covering on it. If you have the money for this, spend a few extra dollars and get your child a nabi, or kindle kids direct from amazon. Do NOT try to cut corners and buy a cheap tablet like this for your child, you WILL be disappointed. Others may have had a better experience however this is ours and we would not recommend anyone purchase this.
R1G4LNL3TIRC4R	4.0	Not a bad little tablet!	0	0	Its actually not bad especially considering the price. The screen resolution isn't very good and it does have a lot of glare but if you use the brightly colored screen saver the glare improves. The battery is not the best and averages around 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 hours on a charge. Also the speaker and cameras are so so but get the job done. Now for the good stuff. The processor is fairly fast and can handle multiple applications. The build quality is decent and the sleeve that comes with the kids model is nice. Games and Videos operate smoothly and the 32 GB expansion slot is nice. This is an excellent starter tablet for kids or adults and makes a good throwdown. Overall this tablet is very solid but it can't compete with Samsung, Nexus or Apple.
R2F2DDMPIF455H	2.0	Horrible viewing angles and battery.	0	0	Have only had it a few days but it is fairly bad so far. When viewing from below (such as in a car headrest mounted position while horizontal) or viewing from the left side when vertical, the color washes completely out and is unviewable. The other 3 angles are decent. The battery also is discharging at a rate of around 1% per minute with NOTHING running. Screen on dimmest setting, all network, gps, and bluetooth settings off with all apps closed and it still discharges extremely fast. Wouldn't be a huge deal if it wasn't for the power adapter being a non-usb power plug. I'm pretty much stuck with it for a week as I need it to keep a 2 year old occupied on an 8hr trip. I'll likely be requesting a refund or exchange when I get back.
R3OAKX92HK4Q6	3.0	Decent- just not for small children.	0	0	It might be more obvious for someone else, but sometimes toddlers can get rough with their toys. My husband and I purchased this for our son, who loves to play various educational games on our devices. It functioned well enough, though the video was a bit laggy, and the resolution not as well as on our phones, but broke within about a month and a half when it fell off of the couch. The screen cracked down the middle and we couldn't work with it enough to let him keep playing with it. Basically, if you have a tech interested toddler and you're considering getting them a tablet, just go with the Kindle for kids. Older kids might take care enough not to have any problems with this tablet, but definitely not younger kids.
R2LP0FAR52BUIU	2.0	Ok tablet, cheap screen/speakers, bad return policy, does not last	0	0	We bought two of these and they are ok for kids tablets, but the touch screens are really bad. We didn't think it would be a problem since they were for our kids. Shortly after they started using them the perimeter of the one of the tablet's screens stopped responding to touches.... now it's barely functional since a lot of app controls are along the perimeters :-( With only a 30 days return policy I highly recommend waiting and buying it right before you know it will get heavy use. I bought them a month before we where going to use them on a trip so by the time the kids actually started playing on them the return period was over. Honestly I wish I would have spent a little more on higher quality tablets.
R30DY5RJNJ9QFU	1.0	My 10 year old went back to using her IPod because it's 10x faster and better than this device	0	0	DON"T BUY THIS! It's not worth the money. My 4year old refused to use this device to watch his cartoon shows. My 10 year old went back to using her IPod because it's 10x faster and better than this device. Poor old dad ended up with 2 Dragon Touch to play Poker..seems it's the only think this thing is good for when it's not crashing. PROS: Cheap CONS: Extremely poor resolution and lighting. You will NOT be able to use this device outside in daylight. It is designed to be use indoor and in the dark only. Charger does not work after 30days (luckily you can also use the USB port to charge it). OS crashes often and reboot takes no less than 3minutes. The camera quality on this thing is...not worth mentioning.
RZGETGZGQMA6I	5.0	Nice tablet package for any child or first time tablet user.	0	0	First off I'll say this was my 2nd tablet since the first had a defective battery. What made me return the product and get another was the performance hands down. This is a nice tablet for my 6 y/o girl and I was very impressed. It had the power to run her games and even watch netflix, you tube ect. Since getting the 2nd tablet I have yet to have a issue. Good battery use, charges good, performance is spot on what else can I say? I will say this is a entry level tablet for surfing , youtube ect. I would say this is a step 2 tablet great for younger kids and people with light use it does great stuff. I give this 5 stars because its perfect for my 6 y/o and she can play with this for a few years without any problems..
R3GBGDPUZ55LNP	3.0	Not a great product	0	0	Cons: The sound is really terrible, and still too quiet even when turned up to max. Also, the charging port is very sensitive and the tiny cord comes unattached easily - which is frustrating, because it drains battery really quickly, and then you're left with a dead tablet because it hasn't actually been charging. Pros: The pre-loaded Zoodles app, which gives you options on what apps your child can access on their own, is great. The case that comes with it is great for kids. And obviously the price. But honestly, my two year old Nook HD+ tablet is still faster and a much better quality product than this new one. Summary: Might work well for a younger sibling, or a child who does not plan to use apps/internet often.
R13ZO3D3MGIQ5T	1.0	3 Down	0	0	I bought these for my 2 boys and they worked great for about a month and I was really happy with my purchase. After 1 month, one of the screens just stopped showing up. It went blank for no reason. Luckily Amazon replaced it for me even though I was over the 30 day return period. Well, they worked fine again for a few more months but then my son dropped his on the tile and cracked the screen. It had the rubber case on it but it still cracked unfortunately. After the crack the screen didn't work anymore. So then we were down to 1 tablet. We took it on a road trip and when we got back in town the remaining tablet wouldn't charge anymore. We went through 3 of these in less than 6 months. I won't be buying them again.

R379DM5WI1THHW	5.0	awesome tablet for kids	0	0	i was quite impressed when this tablet arrived. paying under 60 for a tablet for a child, i was expecting a cheaply made plastic toy. much to my surprise this is a well made tablet. this tablet is 7inches and it has headphone jack and has a front and rear camera. it comes with a charger, which is nice a made charger. not one of those cheap chargers that will break easily. when you rotate the tablet the picture rotates too. this tablet comes with a lot of preinstalled kids apps and has google playstore so you can always get more. you can also download youtube kids on there for yur little ones to be able to watch cartoons. i am very happy and impressed with this tablet and i highly recommend it.
R346PEFY2SNQXY	4.0	This one is perfect in condition	0	0	At least it came working! The last one we bought, not from this company nor this brand, was DOA! This one is perfect in condition, my sone LOVES his new "phone" it took us a few mins to figure stuff out, remeber passwords and trying to decide if we wanted to make him a new account. It did come with it own "parental" control and safe kid play apps but they were difficult to manuver for us and it wouldnt let us create a new account so we gave up. Downloaded a "million" apps from google play and he is a happy camper! I love that it came with the extra silicone protector, the other one I purchased said it did and it didn't. Thank you, A. Wasden
RXU7SVXD95HZR	1.0	Eh. Does what we need mostly. UPDATED	17	26	Started out at 5 stars out of the box; we have had it 2 weeks and having issues already. Overall for $60 you get what you pay for; does what we need most of the time. But don't expect it to be perfect. Here is more in depth if you care to keep reading. We originally got this for my daughter (5) for homeschooling. Like the easy to use Zoodles already pre-loaded with games. Wish we could turn off videos. Has enough memory for what we need and a slot for adding more. Easy to add new apps, and use browser and amazon apps too. Parent Dashboard is easy to understand but kind of frustrating seeing all the stuff I cant do unless I pay them money. No, I am not going to upgrade Zoodles; stop asking and take away the teaser features. Password to exit zoodles can be birthday or customized by changing settings. No issue there. I also have synced it with my calendar so her daily sch is right there for me. So far our biggest issues: Battery Life: Out of the box says charge for 9 hours. We charged for over ten hours and on first time using battery was dead in 25 minutes (timed it.) Now that we have had it a few weeks charge seems to stick longer and can get a few hours. Does charge fast though. Freezes/Shut down: More and more it just freezes up. And many times it will totally turn off and restart: or just shut down completely requiring a manual restart. Very disappointing for how little we use it and how short a time we have had it. ********************UPDATE JUNE 19 2015*********************** Uploaded a video. this is what it does when it freezes. does this at least 3-4x a week. sometimes for over an hour. wont turn off. What a Waste of money... we use it 1-2x a day. we have never dropped it. Have not even had it two months. My daughter really was enjoying the educational games. DO NOT BUY THIS
R117N19T8MB5RL	5.0	Nice, affordable tablet.	1	1	Easy to set up and kids enjoy it!I like the soft color scheme as well. GOod for boys and girls.
R2X8YI247RJ7JT	2.0	Short lived	0	0	It was good while it lasted. I haven't had it a month and the lock button broke on it so it's done for since that's also the on/off button. My daughter loved it though. Played games, movies, Netflix well. However if I bought movie I could only watch it using wifi. If I tried to download for use without internet, no movies would play. Also none of the preloaded YouTube kid videos that were in the zoodles kid app would play and it's not because of Internet connection. Even though she couldn't do everything it was still a life saver, while it lasted. Maybe I just got a defective one. But not impressed that the lock button broke since it's rarely dropped and has the amazing cushy cover.
R95G02RRGK22Q	2.0	Ok tablet, cheap screen/speakers, bad return policy, does not last	0	0	The tablets are ok, but the touch screens and speakers are incredibly cheap. We didn't think it would be a problem since it was for our kids, but shortly after they started using it the perimeter of the screen stopped responding to touches.... now it's barely functional since a lot of app controls are along the perimeters :-( With only a 30 days return policy I highly recommend waiting and buying it right before you know it will get heavy use. I bought it a month before we where going to use it on a trip so by the time the kids actually started playing on it the return period was over. Honestly I wish I would have spent a little more on a higher quality tablet.
R1IQZJG01N6ITY	5.0	I love this thing	0	0	I love this thing. I bought it for my son yesterday afternoon, and it was here first thing in the morning. I set it up while he was still sleeping, and he's now watching Little Einsteins up in his room on it. The speaker is great, it definitely works great, it's definitely fast enough for my 2 year old, the touch screen works great, and I love that I can put games and apps from the playstore in the "kids area" (I can't remember the exact name of it). Only draw backs I see are the case is a little loose on the corners, the battery life isn't great (but I also haven't charged it to 100% yet) and it gets hot fast. But seriously..for the price, you can't beat it.
R27P3F3WTMKHEP	1.0	Not charging	1	1	I've had the tablet for less than a month and it's no longer charging and therefore useless.
R7KU7ZXZPKRUV	5.0	Perfect tablet for kids	0	0	I got this to replace my son's more expensive tablet. At half the price, he can do everything that he was doing on his previous one - checking e-mail, texting, playing games, surfing, doing research for his homework, etc. The screen resolution is the only thing that I can notice. Having said that, they didn't compromise too much on the quality of the screen. You can notice the difference, but it doesn't minimize your tablet using experience. I highly recommend this one. You don't have to break your bank to get a quality tablet. Note: the screen protector is already put on the tablet, so all you need to do is put on the silicon cover to protect your tablet.
R2P61UKSBXLXWY	1.0	Battery doesn't hold a charge.	0	0	So disappointed. This is for a child, it's cheap, I didn't expect the works. However, my son opened this for his birthday yesterday, it charged all night, and just from my daughter setting him up an email and a wallpaper, the battery drained to 18%. It went back on the charger this morning and 6 hours later it still isn't fully charged. Again took it off to check it out and it drained quickly. Kicking myself because I thought I read enough reviews to side on this tablet being worth it, but clearly not. We have gotten out other children the RCAs for the same price and haven't had any issues, opted for this one because of the silicone case since he is younger.
R152AKEQRPMGH7	5.0	Great tablet for kids that can do it all!	0	0	I bought two of these tablets for my 5 year old twins, after they destroyed a couple iPads. The price was right and I figured even if they broke them, $60 to replace is way more affordable than a couple hundred bucks for a new iPad. I was pleasantly surprised! They can still watch Disney toy collector on YouTube, their favorite movies on Netflix. And so far, all the games and preschool stuff they enjoy we have found apps for too. They are made for kids to use, so they are more durable than an iPad. The included rubber bumper provides great protection. These tablets are still growing strong after being used all summer long. More than I can say for the iPads!
R3VYREKJ286AP2	3.0	It's decent for the price.	0	0	Bought this for my 4yr old for his birthday. He loves all the kid apps it comes with.. I have also downloaded additional ones for him to play. The tablet is really slow and has a very short battery life. It doesn't say anything about the camera pixels (or I might've missed it) but its really low. pictures are very blurry. But I got the tablet mostly for educational apps and get my son away from the tv and video games so I love that this has parental controls and you can choose which apps the kids can open. I would not watch Netflix or youtube on this tablet as it is very slow and will drain the battery life very fast and it shows in very poor quality.
R1UV271QE230CQ	2.0	too slow	0	0	The item was shipped fast. No doubt about that. Came in good condition. I bought it for my 6 year old (high functioning autistic girl) for her long bus rides. First I had troubles finding a good free games/books for her, the zoodles came only with very baby-ish games and a book. She had trouble the very first day she used it. It's just way too slow. Then when she tried to go back home from playing a game, it wouldn't show her the home button. Had to reboot. Over all, if for a younger child, and willing to spend money on every app, then it's not bad. For a child who already knows how to use an Ipad or samsung tablets, way too slow and frustrating.
R2T2BKMFGWU9JP	3.0	Do a Little Prep-Work - Helpful Instructions Provided by Another Reviewer	0	0	I highly recommend you read and follow the guidance in the review titled, "1-star when you open the box; please read for how to make it a 4-star buy" in the following link: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SH4OODU?tag=over4n-20 I took the less than 30 minutes that were required to follow the instructions provided by this person, and was able to get this product working relatively easily. I haven't given it to my granddaughter yet - I was anxious to get it up and running so she could start playing with it right away. Seems to working well now - I'll update my review after she's had it a while.
R22LOV7HUOTZNU	5.0	Great Enexpensive Childrens Tablet!!!!!	0	0	I bought this tablet for my son for X-mas. I was looking for a tablet with a full Android OS in parental mode and a kids mode which would only allow them to access the apps I allowed. This little tablet hit the nail on the head. Puts the apps you choose to go into children's mode right into a nicely laid out menu that voice guides your child through it. Not to mention it came with a great protective case and has loads of educational content. Some comes with the tablet most you have to unlock. No big deal ABC Mouse was my biggest concern and it runs it like a champ. The tablet is an excellent tablet for the money.
RFLMALMIQLFAR	1.0	Defective?	0	0	I am so disappointed with this tablet! I ordered it for my son's 5th birthday, and he was SO excited to have his very own 'big kid' tablet. We've had nothing but problems with it straight out of the box. I charged it for the recommended 10 hrs, but it still wouldn't turn on. When it finally did power on after pressing the button multiple times, it will work for a short while but then start making a very loud piercing noise and shut itself off. It's been a very frustrating and tear filled 2 days of ownership for my little guy. I'm sending it back and reordering another one in hopes we get one that works properly.
RIHI281WSZJCU	4.0	Overall it is a good, inexpensive tablet for a small child	0	0	Overall it is a good, inexpensive tablet for a small child. I purchased this for a 4 year old boy that can destroy about anything. My thought was that if it gets broke after some time that I wouldn't be out too much money. Package arrived on time and damage free. For the price this thing is tough as nails and has handled anything my 4 year old has thrown at it. Definitely have gotten my money's worth out of it and it's still going strong. Some apps load slow, others load fine. Overall if you're looking for an inexpensive tablet I would highly recommend this one. I am very happy with this purchase.
R2XW8E1T35OCI8	3.0	... it is not but for the price it's a good bargain! It good for watching videos on YouTube	0	0	An iPad it is not but for the price it's a good bargain! It good for watching videos on YouTube, Netflix, etc as well as playing some games such as Minecraft and similar games, but I would not depend on it for intense graphics games\apps. The above said, I would only fault the rubber case. If your child is certain to drop the tablet frequently than this is what you want. However, the additional bulk of the cover made it difficult to access the ports. During headphone use, my nephews had to remove the side closest to the headphone jack because they could not get the jack to stay in place.
R1SU3EWF2THQO5	5.0	Great for kids!	0	0	I got this for my son for his 7th birthday. He is loving it!! It's the perfect size for him and the cover has really helped keep it safe. It comes with a lot of games and videos already installed, as well as a basic art app and a few others. He has installed a few new apps for his homeschool work as well as just for play and still hasn't used all the memory yet. With the warranty I am not as worried about letting him carry the tablet wherever he goes. This is a sturdy device and great for kids! We will be purchasing another one very soon for my other sons' birthday - he can hardly wait!
R1BCMK3CUS1JQS	5.0	Perfect Tablet for Kids	0	0	Exactly what I wanted for my kids. It works. It has Google Play Services and the Google Play store. It has run nearly every app I have downloaded, and played movies from files and Netflix without a hitch. It is not the fastest tablet, but for the price it is everything you could want. We did not experience any problems with the screen protector, and the silicone case has protected it from many falls. The viewing angle on the screen is poor, but it works great for one or two people sitting close to it. The narrow viewing angle could be a feature, not a bug, to improve privacy.
R1RSFSEF2GOS9H	1.0	Garbage	0	0	Someone took the time to write a how to and claimed that this was a good tablet if you take the time to follow these simple steps haha. Out of the box, the thing is useless. Followed along with the how to- the steps do not work. This is a china piece of crap rushed to market that simply does not work.nothing about the tablets work correctly. I bought 1 for my niece and 1 for my nephew- I'm out of the return period and would rather throw them away which I'm doing than have my family deal with this frustration. These are garbage please please do not buy. Whoever left a good review was paid to do so.

This tablet is awful ! It took a day for it to change to 65%, then i downloaded a fée games and it cut off. I plugged it up and it show 2%. So i left it on charge for 12 hours it was on 95% m'y son played one game for about 30 mins and again another 30 mins and it cut off again at 50%. Im so upset and there is nothing i can do but send it back and have no tablet for him. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PEICE OF CRAP !!
R2C28T36ZKV8WQ	5.0	Reasonably priced kid's tablet	0	0	I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter's fourth birthday. I found the price to be quite reasonable for a child's tablet. I like the fact that it came with the silicone sleeve, making it much easier to hold on to. My only worry is that the tablet may overheat in the sleeve, but so far, so good. I configured Zoodles Kid mode and downloaded some other children's games before giving it to her. She absolutely loves it and so far there have been no issues. I would have liked to have more memory and storage, but she is happy with the tablet. I feel it was a worthwhile purchase. This is about a second Dragon Touch 7" Quad Core Android Kids Tablet I purchased: Because I was so pleased with this tablet, I purchased an identical tablet for my other granddaughter's third birthday. I also configured this tablet prior to giving it to her. The second tablet seems to be just as good as the first one purchased except I'm having problems getting Zoodles to run on this new tablet (everything runs fine on the first tablet) Because the app was preinstalled on the tablet, I cannot uninstall a bad installation and reinstall the program. Other than that, this is a great tablet.
R1TJDKMSHCUOJP	4.0	perfect inexpensive kids tablet	0	0	Perfect little tablet for my busy 2 year old. I actually just bought a second one for a friend of mines kid. I like that it's inexpensive so if he breaks it somehow it's not a ton of money down the drain. I also love that it already comes with a case and it's easy to hold. The battery life has much to be desired for (which is why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5) so it's not something good for road trips or long bus rides(unless you can be charging it while it is being used), it does charge up pretty fast though. It doesn't run super fast, but then again, was not expecting top technology for the price. Overall a decent tablet, especially for it's price and I would definitely recommend it.
R2OL84XHLM41KZ	5.0	Great Kids Tablet!	0	0	As an adult, I wished this tablet was a little faster and the screen a little sharper, but for a child, it's perfect! My stepdaughter is 5 years old and she loves this tablet! I was looking for an alternative to her wanting to play games on our phones, but didn't want to break the bank. This tablet was affordable and she had no trouble using it. She plays lots of games, and with Netflix downloaded, she also watches plenty of movies. No issues with this tablet after a week of heavy use. The screen protector and rubber case were also excellent bonuses. I would definitely recommend it!
RICYN6J0EYHV0	4.0	Good buy for the money	0	0	Good buy for the money. After the initial charge of 10 hours the tablet lasted about 4 hours of use. It then recharged to full in about two hours. I didn't like the standard kids center that comes on this so I downloaded the free app Kids Place. This tablet with that application is perfect for my son, who is 6 months old. I expect that this device will last quite some time and if I ever needed to borrow it for other purposes (like movies, tv, music, etc.) I certainly could. I would give five stars if the tablet lasted a little longer and the standard kids apps were better.
R28MQ2SOQAW9N0	5.0	For a cheap tablet it does the job nicely	0	0	For a cheap tablet it does the job nicely. It has access to google play apps, has enough storage leftover for enough apps and movies, cpu is sufficient to play movies and games, battery lasts for 4-5 hrs. The only area where its a bit let down is the touchscreen, it's not very accurate where you can drag and drop very small areas of the screen (e.g. like in Dr Panda Daycare). But realistically I wouldn't pay extra money to have that issue fixed. So for the price it's a win. When my 2.5 year old toddler is older i'll get a better tablet but for this age its the right buy.
R1FUAF71Z2JKZZ	2.0	After about a week the power button broke i decided to return it because well what Good is it with out a power button	0	0	Sorry to say this is kind of disposable tablet. Worked ok for a day or so then it started to freeze and glitch. But i gave it another chance before i decided to give it a star trading of two. The tablet itself is decent nothing to wipe about but ok for the price. This is not a child's tablet as my daughter used it to watch movies on car rises and games. After about a week the power button broke i decided to return it because well what Good is it with out a power button. I would say the tablet is good for a light user but not a child or teenager that constantly will use it.
R1V8DN21I35Q1M	2.0	For the first couple months I loved this tablet for her	0	0	I was looking for a tablet my toddler could entertain herself and learn from. I didn't want something expensive because more than likely she would destroy it. For the first couple months I loved this tablet for her. The quality wasn't great but I love the navigation throughout the system for a child. The screen would always mess up but after a couple minutes it would go away. My child has not been rough with tablet at all. Now everytime you turn the tablet on it only works for a little bit then freezes up. Next time I will dish out the money for a more reliable product
R2UWLKYPVJVT6E	1.0	Don't waste your money	0	0	This is a fine tablet for the money. I fiddled around with it, much like another reviewer here, to get rid of stuff that wasn't needed. I had prior experience with Zoodles and I never liked that, so that was the first to go. I love the rubber casing, it gives it a nice "feel" in the hands. It is not really intuitive but once you get it, it's no problem. 7/31/2015 I have downgraded my review to one star. The battery life on this is pitiful, and three days after the return period expired (so we've had it one month) it won't accept a charge. I know it wasn't very much money but I thought we'd get more than four weeks out of it. Amazon customer service ROCKS OUT LOUD but for the moment I have a very unhappy 5 year old.
R30MI82Y0G3RX8	3.0	ok tablet - battery doesn't hold charge and washed out screen	0	0	I was excited to get that tablet for my son. He's 3.5 years old and he's used to 10 ipad. Tablet is good looking with silicone cover. Fired with no problems, charged to 100%, installed some apps for my son. He played with it for about 15 min and he goes daddy my tablet is broken. So I plugged in the charger let it charge and after second charge it lasted about 45 min. Screen is kind of washed out - colors are bad and I can see pixels and different shades of colors when I hold tablet on different angles. Unfortunately had to return it and I'm getting something else.
R3L9PWMLS2UDAV	5.0	Great kids tablet for the price	0	0	I bought two of these for my six and four year olds. They love it. It has all the features of a tablet twice the price and i love the protective cases. The audio the good enough for kids however the camera quality isn't the best. But again my kids love it. They love the rear and front cameras for taking selfies. The battery time is about two hours maybe a little more. But it charges really quickly and I was pleased that the charger was like the old Nokia phone chargers making it easier for the kids to charge them without damages. I would buy this tablet again
R2K4FTWEIHSQYW	1.0	Don't waste your money	0	0	Don't waste your money, I wish I would have spent the extra money and bought a better tablet because now I have to buy one anyway after a month of having this!!! When I first received it I had problems with the charging port, the charger had to be held in to charge properly so I purchased a charger to go in the mini hdmi port. NOW the screen is not functioning properly, I tap one spot and it acts like I'm tapping 10, and is unusable. So take my advice and spend double the money or in a month you will be kicking yourself when you have to buy a better anyway.
R1NS50MOZH6YJM	1.0	disappointed, upset,,	0	0	I recently just bought a dragon touch a1x plus and have had no issues thus far. But right out of the bloody box this had issues, mainly one huge issue. I go to turn on my sons tablet for his birthday and start to set up the parental settings on it, it glitched out turn to green tint and now will no longer turn on. I want a replacement or my money back. This was for my son on his birthday June 8th. I'm more then irritated, and will be quite upset if I can't have his birthday present to him by then. I would vary much like someone to contact me ASAP please.
R17CRKDGBVLCMD	5.0	I Love This Tablet For My 4-Year Old Grandson and He Loves It Too -- He Gets To Learn A Lot of New Things Everyday	0	0	My 4-year old grandson LOVES his tablet. We needed to start it up for him and figure a few things out before he could start playing on it and he needs help from time to time, but he is becoming a wiz at it. There are endless learning games on there that I personally like for him, so I am satisfied. It certainly keeps him busy during down time. Of course I am not around him 24/7 but I think I taught my daughter and son-in-law well enough that they stick mostly to games where he can learn and not play with junk. I love it and he loves it. It's a win-win.
R1ECA86DNWWZEZ	3.0	Meh - You Get What You Pay For	0	0	I got this for my 5-year old daughter - figured, great she can watch Netflix and do some games for $60 - not a bad deal. First, it's fine. No no, it's fine. It's just such a slow, frustrating comparison after having a Kindle and iPad. Yes, it works - you can watch Netflix, but the graphics/sound are so inferior. It's also incredibly slow - it will go into "sleep" mode while trying to download apps because it takes so long. The case isn't hard, it's just spongy plastic. We have 3 kindle fires and I should've stuck with the brand I know.
R73C86IE8CJJQ	4.0	Good for the price so far working well	0	0	Bought these for my 8 and 9 year old boys who have broken a tablet about every 6 months. They have had them for 6 weeks now and they seem to be working fine. I added 32gb card to them and they have downloaded over 15 games each. The tablets still working fine with no delays, watch movies via WIFI and all is well. I think it would be better without the zoodles it is a bit of a hassle at times blocking things for apps they need for school. They will charge via charger or USB which is very nice. The covers fit well and so far have held up perfectly.
RYSZ9E5IE0PRA	1.0	Avoid at all costs	1	1	Screen broke while trying to put on red case.. didn't even get to use it..
R1SSFUXPWNLTOX	4.0	Great	0	0	Got this for my 6 year old son after his sister shattered the screen on his galaxy tab. We have had it for a couple months and it is working great. The screen does scratch pretty easily, but that is something a screen protector can easily prevent. It does run a little slow at time, but I think that is because he leaves so many apps open. He watches videos on it daily and the battery holds up pretty well. It was a good replacement for the price and we are satisfied. The case is nice and snug so I don't have to worry about it coming off.
R23HGMLVZUZCA	5.0	Takes alot of damage, and great for toddlers who love to learn.	0	0	I gave one to my son on his 2nd birthday. He sings the ABC and knows all his colors shapes and numbers up to 10. I believe him interacting with the things he learns by touch screen have helped along with me being there and encouraging him. Anyways this little tablet has gone through so much. Like milk being poured over it several times, being dropped and thrown, stomped on and being left in a car on a hot day. The tablet has seriously taken a lot of damage. But still works fine. So surprised by that, considering the low price.
R362QH3MGTK6T8	4.0	Great tablet for kids	0	0	Great little tablet, I wish it was just a tad bigger screen. My kids love it. They don't care that both cameras are low resolution since they are 3 and 5. When they grow up and become more responsible they can have an iPad, for now this is in their "won't break the bank" range. I love that it has a SD card slot so they can watch a bunch of movies on it. The tablet is little sluggish and viewing angle is poor but i'll take that as a compromise for a lower price. The speakers could be louder.
R31N4K4NH587YT	1.0	Nothing but problems	0	0	We bought three of these for our kids just 3 months ago, and have had nothing but problems. One we have had replaced twice now because of charging problems. The second one the screen cracked. And the third is now also having charging problems. TabletExpress have been good about sending replacements, but obviously we would prefer to have a product that doesn't need constant replacing! This seemed like such a good deal, and the reviews were good. But you really do get what you pay for. Save your money and get something better.
R1G45P1SQU1BGV	5.0	Yes! Yes! Yes! Worth every dime!	0	0	It's just like my phone, so navigating through it is simple for my 4 year old son and myself. It's sturdy, clear display, the "bumper" casing is thick and its been dropped from about 24 inches already and it protected it well. This tablet is a "at the table only" or "in the car" tablet right now. If my son was a rambunctous child, this would NOT be something I'd give him. If he's having an excessively active day, he gets his Leap Pad instead! Spend a lil extra money and get the screen protectors too.
R20TLCYG3WGV4Q	1.0	Not at all happy with this product	1	1	Very slow and freezes all the time. Not at all happy with this product!
R32UGKDXOVYM3I	4.0	Great Value!	0	0	I bought this for my 4-year-old stepdaughter, primarily for the pink case (her favorite color). I bought a King Pad in purple for her older sister. This is definitely the better tablet of the two. This battery lasts longer, and the parental settings are more secure. It comes with a wall charger, but there's a micro USB port so I usually use my phone charger. The memory hasn't been an issue so far--she mainly uses it to play games and watch Netflix kids--but I do like the fact that I could add a memory card if needed.
R3DE349JRFL5DQ	2.0	Pending rating based on customer service response. Beware of the non-working on/off switch.	0	0	This is a pending review. I bought the tablet about 5 months ago. I was extremely happy with the product. I felt that the battery life was great, the durable case was awesome, etc. Now after five months of my daughter getting used to using her tablet and staying off my phone, the on and off switch doesn't work. I have tried for two days to contact the seller with no response. No one was able to answer the phone. I left my contact information on the voicemail. Depending on my answer this rating could go up or down.
R25Y22I5UMD7PV	5.0	Excellent choice for the money	0	0	I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it. I also ordered screen protector to help save the screen. The tablet requires to be set up initially prior to using, but it is a basic stuff and can be easily set up by an adult or an older child. I like the fact that it has the rubber case with an easy grip, and very easy for a child to hold on to. The device is simple enough to be used by a child and at the same time entertaining. This toy can definitely buy you an hour of free time for yourself.
R1AGSNUIAXEYJW	3.0	The battery life isn't too bad, but charging takes a long time	0	0	We have had this in use for a few months now. They are still working. I ordered two of them at this time, and they came different? For some reason, one came with bluetooth capability, and the other did not. This was a bit of a downfall, but isn't used much in our home. The tablet is fast enough for most android kids games, and running kids youtube and netflix. The battery life isn't too bad, but charging takes a long time. Also, the cheap charging ports are not very good. I see these being the weakest link.
RIG7HU8M8E2XA	1.0	Not worth the money.	0	0	So far this item has been well below expectations! After initially starting it up, on my 8 year olds birthday, it allowed us to download one game and than after that it will not download more. I have restarted it, tried to link it in with my computer, everything. It will not bring up that zoodle games, none of the preloaded apps will come up and now it will not even accept my email address to open up google. I realize now that I'm just out the money, and my 8 year old has a tablet that can't even be used!!! Addition, have decided to send this back and ask for a refund. I will find a different tablet for my 8 year old. Additional note, thank you Amazon for refunding the money right away on this item! I have now purchased an Amazon fire (which I should have done in the first place, shame on me). I'm sure my 8 year old will be much happier with that!
RPN3O8TIK58Z7	2.0	You get what you pay for	0	0	Bought two of these tablets based on all the "good reviews". within 2 weeks use one failed to charge and had to be replaced by the company which handled the claim by replacing the tablet in 10 days turn around time. Now after 1 month use the other tablet power button is broken and will not work. These were gently used by my 8 year old twins. These tablets are cheap and will not last long. Their customer service is decent but to buy brand new tablets that only last 2-4 weeks is ridiculous. Buyer beware
RN12SE8CYTW3Q	5.0	Good Value.	0	0	I bought 2 of these for my 6 and 4 year old grandchildren. They love them and keep them busy for hours. They treat them roughly and we have had no problems of any kind. They are recharged every night and although they won't last all day at daycare everyone has been pleased with their battery life. I did buy screen protectors to go with them and these have also worked well. I had read several negative reviews before buying them but we had experienced none of the problems mentioned. They are a good value.
RW39VUKQGS6SB	1.0	One Star	1	1	Didn't have it a month and it quit working. Waiting for an exchange.
R36UYPVUE5VRRS	1.0	not satisfied	1	1	Works for a week then goes dead. Bought for my toddler. Bad purchase.
R217IKWMM2G02C	3.0	Not a good product but great customer service .	0	0	I bought this one as a gift for my nephew . It was working just fine then after 10 days the wi-fi just didn't work anymore . they asked me to update the system which was way too complicated than what you would expect . BUT the customer service was 10/10 they worked with me till I was able to send them the device back and they did a full refund even It took me 1 month after the issue to be able to send it back . Maybe that was one device problem because otherwise the tablet works just fine .
R2Z0VOKN6H94LO	5.0	Great tablet for an amazing price!	0	0	I bought this tablet as a gift for my son for his 4th birthday. It came very quickly & was packaged well. Upon opening I was very impressed with the quality of the tablet. I also was excited to find that it included a screen protector that I was not aware of. He has been using the tablet daily for about a month and we have had no issues. It is fast, has an amazing picture, and holds a charge well. We also own several other brand tablets and I would absolutely choose this tablet over more expensive brands.
R1VKS2MTPWSF9H	1.0	My 2 year old left Traumatized !!!!!	0	0	I'm very sorry I did not read more of the comments & give credibility to the ones that are negative; because here I am now so disappointed with this product's performance. The battery holds charge for about an hour & a half ; some apps failed to download & eventually after 2 weeks it refused to turn on & remains in that condition even until now. I would not recommend this tablet to any one. It has left my 2 year old traumatized & disappointed. I'm going to purchase a different one elsewhere for him.
R1TWS2FREXDFNP	2.0	Touchscreen shattered under normal touch	0	0	Tablet seemed okay except for very low sound and a bit sluggish but after about 2 1/2 weeks, my 36 year old daughter was using the tablet and touched the lower right-hand corner when the screen shattered (spider-web) to the opposite corner and up the screen. There was no impact, flexing, or any sort of abuse ... just a normal touch when this happened. Obviously defective and I'm returning it for credit. No real interest in trying another Chinese tablet. Will pay a little more for some quality.
R1MA3W3VZW0UNH	1.0	bought this for my 5 year old...	0	0	Got this for my five year old. It lasted about 3 weeks. The tablet was slow on the buttons on the touch screen. Very laggy. The build seemed cheap and so did the outer buttons. This tablet is fragile and not for kids. The cover that comes with it helps a little but it is still fragile. My 5 year old managed to crack the screen after owning it for almost 3 weeks. Sure, it's a cheap pad, but you get what you pay for in this case. I would not recommend this tablet to anybody, especially a kid.
R1TH03CWPC37VW	1.0	Do not waste your time or money!	0	0	The worst product I have ever bought! The battery will not charge fully and drops 5 to 6 % as soon as unplugged! Also maybe 5 minutes into playing an app downloaded from play store a message comes up every time saying that the app has ended. My son got so frustrated with it and I'm very disappointed it was for his birthday on the 7th. I am now having to wait for a refund so I can order a new one from a different company and it will not get here until August 19th (over a week after his birthday)!
RY80YNB4XF828	3.0	but the "receiver" of the call will see your face super big.	0	0	Well.. the first one arrived broken.. The replacement arrived ok but it is very slow. I really doubt that this is a real quadcore. Skype works, but the "receiver" of the call will see your face super big.. like if the front camera of the tablet is zooming on you. Zoodles.. works fine, but the send video-message function is not working correctly. The videos are taken in very poor resolution and No-Audio... what is the point of a video message from your daughter with no Audio??
ROQXW6ZOCX53L	1.0	Buyers Beware. 90 warranty only	0	0	I purchased this item directly from the manufacturer ebay. Was somewhat pleased with the item until it started to not fully charged. I tried the suggestions from Tablet express and same. Also the item is sluggish at times and not responsive to the touch. The tablet was put away since. You are better off buying an used tablet from a reputable company than with Tablet Express. Their price is good however the reliability and support are really non existence.
R4N4982I5HANN	3.0	got two one did not work properly	0	0	So I got two of these and on the back camera would not work and the insides were rattling around. But amazon is replacing and has already sent a new one. The on that worked I had to make some adjustments to it new ui launcher "kids launcher" and "kids youtube". The battery life kinda sucks my daughter can get about 45min to about an hour. Fyi the micro usb dose charge it and the case is good. So far I like it for my 2 year old and my 6 year old will get the new one
RXY1R1WBSB2RH	2.0	Not worth the hassle	0	0	This tablet lasted exactly 6 days, at first it was everything that I had hoped it would be. However all of a sudden my son said it was frozen and would not do anything. I factory reset it and still nothing, the touch screen would not respond to anything. I am so bummed out that I have to return it and find something new as this tablet got great reviews and that was my reason for purchase. Did not hold up at all and we are talking about minimal use maybe 1-2 hours a day at best.
RBZV95EFAOWS5	1.0	Not worth it	0	0	I bought this tablet for my son; who, at the time, was 2 1/2. It was great! For maybe 2 1/2 weeks. One day the screen just stopped working. The screen wouldn't respond to anything but the power button, which makes the screen appear. So I sent it back. I got it with prime so returns were hassle free. I then ordered a knew one, it worked for about 2 days then the buttons broke. Returned again. Maybe I just had a bad experience but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
R3O1Q6IDLT25L7	2.0	Save you money	0	0	I purchased this for my 5 year old grand daughter, it worked Great for a little over one month. One day the battery would not recharge, no big deal I thought, I'll try a different charger, 2 weeks later I am still waiting for it to recharge. This had a very nice screen, the colors were bright and the screen was very responsive until THAT day. I have given up on it and have since purchased a Kindle Fire for my grand daughter. Save your money and stick with brand name items.
R3H3Q0I4XB5LYZ	2.0	Disappointed in the Dragon Touch	0	0	Using the Dragon Touch 7" Quad Core Android Kids Tablet hasn't been a satisfying experience. The charger that comes with it stopped working after the first or second use and I was ready to return it, but charging with a Micro-usb works. The battery life is much shorter than other tablets on the market and my child has a hard time turning it on. She likes it once it is on and charged though. One of the reasons we bought it was for the protector, that does seem to work.
R18OO4UR4DGJP9	1.0	DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS!!!!!!!	0	0	My sons father got him this tablet for our son birthday.Before giving it to him i tried to upload his games that he like to play on it. It look me well over an hour to put ONE game on this thing. its like there was a ghost touching the screen when i pushed a buttons. Things would pop up that i never even touched volume would go up and down. It got to the point that my child won't even play with it any more after beating it off the couch cause it kept freezing on him.
R3NMXTHOV5DWGN	3.0	Slowski	0	0	Overall the unit works well. However, loading programs and downloading streams from Wi-Fi takes a little time. Tried the software that was recommended with it for children and i could never get that to run. One thing did work great I was able to download movies with the Xfinity 2go app. This allowed us to take the movies with us and the kids were able to watch it on this tablet. So if you're going to download movies this would be the perfect unit for this application.
R9MXEUA2OQDUJ	5.0	Five Stars	1	1	got my 7 year old off of my phone. very grateful. affordable.
R1ZZYMS1OSFIXH	3.0	The new tablet works fine so far	0	0	The first time I ordered it took longer than expected to recieve. After finally receiving it, the tablet was faulty. It kept shutting off and then after a day or so, it wouldn't even power on. Just made a clicking noise. We were only given the option of a refund therefore after repurchasing the tablet we had to pay shipping and handling a second time. The new tablet works fine so far. My 2 yr old loves the zoodles pre installed app. Had for about a month now.
R2X7ATY11QUFF7	1.0	cheap cheap cheap	0	0	I got this tablet for my 5 year old daughter thinking it would be ideal but it sucks first of all the charger broke right away where it plugs into the tablet secondly the mic doesn't work for the life of me and with a 5 year old who doesn't know how to spell it's a necessity camera quality is horrid all I can say is cheap cheap cheap take the time and spend a little bit more money and get something decent otherwise your kid will surely break this before you know it
R2R2IQ4HBZ311H	2.0	Poor battery life	0	0	The "child" software for the tablet is constantly crashing, so we didn't even bother with it. The battery only lasts about an hour, and dies at a rate of about 10% battery per hour that it's not being used (I followed the instructions about charging for 10 hours before the first use and have only been using it for a week). It would be a solid tablet if my son could use it for more than an hour without having to charge it for twice as long to use it again...
R2JYDVR8J2VLB9	1.0	Cheap piece of junk	0	0	Took tablet out of box, charged it completely and had to push the ON button 3 times to get it to power on. Main screen came on after 5 minutes. Pushed the volume button and the screen went crazy. Then the tablet froze. Turned off and back on and same thing happened. So much for quality. You really do get what you pay for. Off to ship this junk back and buy a Samsung tablet for my toddler because apparently any tablet under $120 is cheaply made and a piece of crap.
R257G9NH0J33E6	1.0	PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!	0	0	This item is horrible nothing like what I read in the comments about it. People was saying how good it was how good it looks but I don't like at all. The tablet looks real cheap. When I connect to my wifi it goes slow unless I'm in the room with the motum. The letters on the keyboard stopped working after sometime. I will return this and get my refund for a better tablet. The only thing I like about this is the rubber bumper. This doesn't even deserve one star.
R1RG3DXRGEN87F	1.0	Dragon Touch	0	0	This item looks nice, but we could not even use it, we could not connect to the google play, we could get on the internet just find but it would not let us use the google play which you need to even use the devise. And we only ordered this a month ago and we could not even return it, the time ran out.....REALLY! I would not recommend this to anyone, what a disappointment. If there was a way to select no stars that is what I would use.
R3Q3FZFU1ZD7TJ	5.0	They love them. For the price	0	0	Bought these for my kids for their birthdays. They love them. For the price, I was very impressed with the operation. I never set up the zoodles app, so never dealt with that. Runs all the games my kids play just fine. The rubber case is nice. Very protective. One of my kids has dropped it in the floor at the store, all it did was bound and there was no damage. The screen does scratch fairly easily but that can be solved by a screen protector.
R5T2NA7N7INSK	4.0	These are so helpful at keeping my house clean	0	0	Once you disable the zoodles app and kid mode and install amazon app store it's a great tablet. But zoodles will not work on this tablet because it needs a flash player that's not compatible with the device. Now that it's done my kids love it. I have five year old twins and I work full time so yes, this unfortunately has to be a fill in baby sitter at times. But now that I have the tablets my kids are relaxing and learning instead of thrashing my house!
R1TVP0TKQ9UR66	4.0	In my opinion this tablet is so good for the money	0	0	In my opinion this tablet is so good for the money. It comes with pre-installed apps for children already to play and you can download whatever you want from the Google app store too. It has a USB port and micro SD slot. What I like so much is the cover it comes with. It is a silicone cover that will really protect the tablet against drops. The camera quality is not what I was expecting but for kids it is not that bad.So far so good. I like it.
R283S82X6N31CN	5.0	Perfect Kids Tablet	0	0	For what we use it for, its perfect. An adult may not be real happy with the performance, especially compared to today's Ipads and Kindles but for children who just want something to use it couldn't be better. The price is great, the case is soft and protects from drops, and you can set kids mode up and lock them into it so they don't get in trouble doing something they shouldn't. Our son loves it and we've loaded it with puzzle and brain game apps.
R2F5OJQD38YAON	1.0	Don't waist your time!!!!	0	0	I only gave this product a one because there was no zero. Uhh!!! I hate this tablet!!! Okay I get that it is $50 bucks and what was I expecting right? Wrong! my kids can't even see what they are doing, the screen is so dark, the "touch screen" does not let you maneuver and you have to charge it after an hour of straight use. AHHHHHH!!!!! If any one has any other tablet suggestions that are reasonably priced we would be eternally grateful.
R2PXPETSXNMX7E	1.0	... broke from the screen next day it arrive not good quality	1	1	It broke from the screen next day it arrive not good quality
R3HHW7SRWOQ0EK	1.0	Dont waste your $$	0	0	Don't waste your money!!! We received this and my son loved it. We charged it and let him play a few games and he watched a couple disney shows from youtube it was great, but when we charged it that night and tried to turn it on and nothing! The screen would light up like it was going to come on but it would just blink the android word on the screen. I'm so disappointed as is my son...I think I will spend a few extra $$ and get a better one!!
R2U13PK1QVVV9T	4.0	Great value for the money	0	0	Great value for the money, however don't expect iPad or Galaxy levels of quality here. The most obvious indicator that this is a bottom dollar tablet is the screen viewing angle and back light. It's just plain hard on the eyes unless you're in a dark room and looking directly at the screen. Any tilting of the screen and looks really bad. Also, the volume isn't as loud as I'd have liked as it's sometimes hard to hear when your in a loud place.
RMAUZBOGIMT7N	2.0	The tablet is very easy to use with small hands	0	0	The tablet is very easy to use with small hands. The only thing I have found I didn't like it the battery does not hold charge. Plug it up and let it charge all night when you unplug it and let it sit off for a few hours, the charge on it is down to 90%. From there, the drops fast. You also have to make sure the charger is in good. Make sure you feel it slide in snug. otherwise for some reason it will drain the battery instead of charge it.
R1UMKMDDFJ10TU	1.0	Not happy with this tablet	0	0	Not happy with this tablet...bought it in July 2015 as a tablet for my 5 year old. At first liked it and recommended it for my nephew a week after I bought it. However...it keeps locking up and I've had to hard reset it and reconfigure it 3 times in a couple months. It's very unstable. If you have an extra hour every couple weeks to deal with this and reinstall what you want... great deal for you. It's now a $60 doorstop at my house...
RRYUBMJKTAKB1	1.0	Thought this was a pretty decent tablet for the price we paid when we ...	0	0	Thought this was a pretty decent tablet for the price we paid when we first started using it. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for our two year old. Was able to download his favorite apps and rubber case was good protection in his little hands. Was super disappointed when the screen started malfunctioning within the first week of use. Went black even when turned on. Had to return the product and would never recommend this tablet to anyone.
R14VZD8QSHR2AD	1.0	NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER	0	0	The Dragon Touch wasn't worth the money- of course you get what you pay for, and I knew this amount had to be too good to be true. My 4 yr old hasn't had it even a month, dropped it one time, on carpet, and the entire screen is busted. Not happy with it at all, other than the busted screen, it was near impossible to get it work with any apps downloaded or that came with the tablet itself. I definitely wouldn't waste my money on this item.
R32EACMK452E7O	5.0	Nice Value!	0	0	I bought this tablet for my 4yr old son and he loves it. I needed a "kid" tablet with a bumper and this seemed to fit the bill. So far the tablet has met my (and my sons) expectations with performance, not blazing fast but more than acceptable for anything my son would want to do or play. I do wish the bumper was a little more "beefy" but it already has dropped a couple of times and no damage was done. I am happy with it!
R2ATJSBQBWBPAP	1.0	Do not order this brand	0	0	I order 2 of these tablets on Sept 27, and 2 weeks later I had to contact Amazon because the screen was going black. The tablet kept freezing so I was able to research on how to reboot the tablet. However. I kept having the same issues. So I called Amazon and they sent me out another tablet. About a week later the new tablet kept shutting down and would not charger. I would not order these tablets apparently this brand has issues.
R13CC33M448LOD	1.0	False advertising	0	0	Where to begin? Oh! The volume on this tablet is basically non-existent. I purchased this tablet with the belief that it will perform better than the brand I previously bought. The speed is ridiculously slow. I recently purchased a new wireless router, but had to revert to older router, because the tablet would not pickup the new wifi connection. You cannot use an sd card to store anything. Sigh I'm just up in arms with this device.
R1ZACK7VNIFLUB	5.0	Save your sanity and buy this for your kids	0	0	Got this for my son's birthday (just turned 8) 2 months ago. He hasn't put it down. It goes in the car with us, went on vacation with us, etc. My son is a talker, this little tablet has made trips in the car SOOO much quieter. I can't speak on the specs, what I can tell you is that he has had NO issues with using it to do everything he wants to do. He has dropped it who knows how many times and the tablet is functioning flawlessly.
RB837H6Q3JR0T	1.0	Don't Buy this Tablet	0	0	We opened this last night for my 4 year old nephews birthday and its Not working still! I can't get parental controls to take my birth year and do anything at all. I can't get my Apps to download I keep getting an error message that Google is not available right now! Really!!!! I use it all day and night any where anytime. I am so mad its not even funny.. and I need to depart now for week-end.. this purchase was a total bust.
R1K4C8C01QIBCQ	5.0	This tab is excellent and decent protective cover with handy holding	0	0	I bought this tab for my 2 years old son. This tab is excellent and decent protective cover with handy holding. Previously I bought another tab, but within one month, its screen was broken. But this tab have protective cover and it is very safer and comfortable to use it. My son loving this tab, as it is attractive for him and easy to handle. The price for this tab is worth to spend on it. I am recommend highly for your kids.
R344SG0FUHVEEY	1.0	Don't waste your money	1	1	Tablet wouldn't turn on after two days. Had to return.
RHBCHDU3MC5C8	2.0	Good, but....	0	0	......seemed like an ideal product for my 6 year old. The cost was good. TabletExpress sent it out quickly. Worked very well. The case is very thick and rugged. Then he dropped it - saw it happen....no big deal with the heavy rubber, I would have thought. However, it was a big deal. The tablet screen ceased to function. About 2/3 of it looks normal and the remaining 1/3 was all pixelated. It lasted about 2 weeks....
R36YNQQE3OV70F	5.0	Great beginner tablet.	0	0	Bought this tablet for my younger son for his birthday. He loves playing with our Samsung Galaxy 4 smart phones, and with this using the Android OS, he feels right at home playing with it. He has had a LeapPad in the past, and this beats it in speed and responsiveness. That was out biggest worry, so we're very glad that we made the purchase. Overall, for $60, it's a great tablet, and I would gladly recommend it to a friend.
R3711RI2995XW8	1.0	This is a horrible product!	0	0	It's slow, really really slow. Youtube doesn't work on it. Half the screen doesn't work. The charger broke the day we got it. The battery doesn't last no time at all. My son charged it all night long, it was at 100% with in 30 minutes of him playing his games it was down to 50%. Over i'm really upset that my kids worked so hard to get them one of these tablets and they are horrible! Would not recommend anyone to get them!
RZX8F62X6WIUW	4.0	Lovely gift andf not to expensive	0	0	I ordered this item for my great niece for her 1st birthday. I know she's to young to use it herself but I thought it would be a great gift for her to watch her videos on (Baby Einstein) since she's so interested in it. She currently uses our phones and iPads to do so now. I know she'll love it. I opened it up and charged it for her so when I give it to her at the party she can use it right away with her parents help :)
R1AUKFPWDPNTJJ	5.0	Happy Grammy!	0	0	I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter who loves playing on my tablet. I read the manual and it was easy to understand even for a completely untechie Grammy! Looks like a "grown-up tablet" with a cool silicone case! She is going to love it! Very well made and good quality materials. I was concerned about the price it would be cheap lightweight toy-like and it isn't at all! Very happy with this purchase.
R2BFVTWL98GV7F	5.0	One of the best purchases I have ever made for my grandson!!!	0	0	My grandson was so happy, I thought he was going to squeeze me to death!!! LoL In the 20 minutes it took for me to drive him home, he had figured out the camera, video recorder & was well on his way to loading his games. He kept saying how happy he was that he didn't have to use his mommy's phone any more & that he couldn't believe he had his very own tablet. I'm sure he will enjoy it for many months to come!

R1E8LTNKLF4GZK	5.0	Five Stars	1	1	Great product service was great would commend to anyone
R2ST537BZMY04X	3.0	Poor packaging	0	0	I purchased this along with a blue one for my 2 grandchildren. The blue one was defective and I returned it. This red one was in a box that had a sticker of a Christmas picture showing the red frame over what I can only assume was a picture of a different color. As far as I know this unit works because I haven't heard otherwise, but as in the case of the blue one, this one also had torn interior packaging.
R1BC3T5ML8HG59	4.0	so good. I used the advice from the top rated ...	0	0	So far, so good. I used the advice from the top rated review on this product and disabled the Zoodles application. My daughter is 6 years old and she would find it incredibly boring. The case is great and everything seems to work well. Wifi connected with no issue, touch screen is responsive, cameras work fine, applications were downloaded without issue and work well. For the price, I am very satisfied.
R2Y5B7X4Z0Z6K3	2.0	breaks easily	0	0	I'm an early shopper and being so I ordered this way in advance for my sons birthday. At first i considered it a good little tablet. He only used it for about a week before it was broken. It slid off his lap on to the couch and then hit the carpeted floor. That was all it took for it to be completely broken. If you do buy this tablet be sure to get screen protectors and possibly a better protective case.
R1S4T58H9AFHU	1.0	I do not know if I just got a specific one that was ready to give way or maybe they are all like this but I am very disappointed	0	0	Its very disappointing that the power button did not survive the very first day of use. For something that kids will use I expected this to be a little stronger. Worthy of note is that this happened even with the "protective skin" on the tablet. I do not know if I just got a specific one that was ready to give way or maybe they are all like this but I am very disappointed with this purchase.

I purchased for my 7 yrs son and it was great, until we noticed that the battery ALWAYS died within 20 minutes! Even while charging the tablet never increased its capacity and the camera is by far inadequate. The camera was blurry, NO flash, doesn't focus, and very poor quality. We were upset and so we are returning it to buy an Amazon Fire tablet... Hope this helps...
RH06JGSPWWOXT	2.0	Don't waste your money!	0	0	We bought this for our oldest daughter to play games on. The batter does not hold a charge. It dies after a short time of being on and actively being used. The DC charging plug is pretty cheap. Seems like it does not go in all the way. The screen is pretty grainy. Overall it's junk. Returned this to purchase a Google Tablet. Well worth the money to return it and purchase something of better quality!
R2A5ORJKFR5DDW	4.0	but it Is a good tablet for the price	0	0	I bought this tablet as a gift for my 3yr old daughter. For her first tablet I didn't want to spend a fortune. So, I shopped around and read lots of reviews and finally decided on the Dragon Touch. So far it has served its purpose. She loves watching videos and playing her app games. Only complaint battery doesn't last much, but it Is a good tablet for the price. Remember you get what you pay for.
R2EJK0KP2ZZ438	5.0	highly recommended	0	0	Bought this for Easter 2015. Its now August. She has dropped this thing on cement, got her sticky fingers all over it, stepped on it and played it for hours on end. If you are scared of getting a younger child this type of device, this is a great choice. Its very fast holds lots of apps, and many pointless pictures and will stand up to abuse. For the$50 or so bucks i paid for it, it can't be beat!
R1QV79SQJBNWUQ	5.0	but I've been having fun as a Mom playing with their devices	0	0	We are just gearing up for a long road trip with 2 and 3 year old kiddos. They have yet to see their surprise, but I've been having fun as a Mom playing with their devices. The parental controls are easy to set and it's easy to download kid-friendly apps. I'm also ordering headphones for kids, so they can both play at once in small quarters (the car)! Nice case and great packaging, to boot.
R226P635911GR1	1.0	Completely Disappointed.	0	0	I bought 5 of these for my elementary classroom, and I couldn't be sorrier that I did. What a waste of money. I had originally intended to buy 5 and then purchase 5 more if the quality was right, but it absolutely isn't. The color/image quality is terrible, they're often slow, and they crash. I won't be buying a product from this manufacturer again. Next time I'll go name brand. Lesson learned.

I opened it to load it up with apps and games before I wrap it and I turned it on and I have no control over the screen. It was doing its own thing like it has been hacked and I could even see it trying to log onto my wifi trying to guess the password. I have tried to call the company several times to see what is going on and I can not get ahold of anyone!!
R23HW58XDCAT3N	3.0	I stopped working the third day of purchased	0	0	buy it because I saw the reviews and they said is a very durable tablet, I regret to say that on the third day of use I stopped working.It is filled with white dots when you try to access any app not working. very disappointed with this purchase, waiting for my daughter could learn using it but it was not. If sending was fast. but the tablet is useless.and the battery life barely three hours.
R1A3WGZV6DAMGR	5.0	Five Stars	1	1	My daughter loves this device she won't put it down.
R2TGU66IRX2Y49	2.0	Bad Product, poor quality	0	0	I rated this product poor because I returned this product due to the fact it would not charge . Now 2 months later I am having the same issue. I have never experienced this many issues with any other purchases through Amazon . Now because it is 2 months later I cannot return this item for a refund. I do not want a replacement and will not buy from this seller again.

I did some research on best tablets for kids and this one came in at number 7. So I decided to purchase them, it comes with a silicone case protector and a screen protector, my kids love them. My 4 year old has dropped it a couple of times and it hasn't fallen apart. Great buy for the money!
R36FRC802JBFPV	1.0	Cheap! WHITE SCREEN ISSUE!! WONT BOOT!!	0	0	I recieved this product and it would not boot past a White Screen!! My son was waiting for this for over a week and finally when we get it, it wont even boot. I am returning it and have already went out and got a better more reliable brand. Nabi!! I was trying to be cheap by buying this, but I will now never buy this brand again. Just spend the extra money and get something more reliable.
RYE5ZXO227KM8	4.0	What you would expect for this price point.	0	0	You know, I bought this for a toddler as his first tablet. It has held up so far without any issues with a child that can dish out the physical excitement. This is a wonderful product for the price. It's not the fastest tablet, but it is fast enough for the purpose intended. Would recommend this for a toddler, but not an older child that would need more functionality and performance.
R2NR66YHB72XMM	3.0	If you really enjoy the feel of a real "Back" button	0	0	If you really enjoy the feel of a real "Back" button, or essentially any button other than OFF or volume, then this is not for you. All controls are touch, so when a program hangs, which unfortunately is all the time, the touch screen stops responding too. Very aggravating when I expected fast, android like control as my Galaxy phone has, which is LIGHT years faster. Too bad.
R1EMUHPDP6ZM3X	5.0	Love this tablet!	0	0	Great Tablet at a great price! I bought this tablet for my 6 yr old granddaughter and it entertains as well as educates her for hours. Love the Zoodles feature that comes with it, there's no need to download apps right away as she could start playing as soon as we got it. Very durable and easy for a young child to handle and use. Would recommend this tablet for any young child.
R13KDMNNGMC0YR	4.0	Great!	0	0	I really like this tablet! I love that it comes with the protective red case which is very durable, we've purchased this kind before for previous tablets. I'm still getting to learn Zoodles but I LOVE how the play store is on here, so I can download all the free apps for my kids to mess around with. It's not just a kids tablet, as an adult I can do whatever I need to on here as well.
R3PXB8EEVG0ZVP	3.0	Three Stars	1	1	Screen cracked after 1week of my grandson having it
R3EFL0W2SD7L7H	2.0	Meh. Zoodle doesn't work, tablet on the low end	0	0	Zoodle doesn't work very well. We got it so it can help with content monitoring, but it slows the system and apps down. It sometimes doesn't run things at all. So we go with adjusting Google Play directly, but its content monitoring stinks. You put "Everyone" and you can still download shooting games. The tablet itself isn't very fast/powerful either. I had a better Tab 3.
R1W2L8VDGFZ0ZU	1.0	WORST PURCHASE EVER!!!!!	0	0	Mt daughter has only had this tablet for 1 month, and it won't charge anymore! Pretty upset as she loves it, and I spent a lot of money on a tablet that lasted 1 month! I never wright reviews, but I would like to save somebody else from spending money on this garbage, and breaking their little kids heart because they only had their bday present for a month! HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!!

I am out $60 bucks and my granddaughter is out of a gift. I very much regret purchasing this item.
R3MHTU78MPML0X	3.0	Tablet looks Nice. It will work for our kid	0	0	Tablet looks Nice. It will work for our kid. The only problem is the case. The case is not kid proff what so ever. Kid dropped it within 2 hours of the tablet arriving and I thought that he broke it. The back popped out and was able to place it back in. Use my hotspot on my phone and it actually doesnt take that long to download apps like other people said on different reviews.
R3C6JK4EBX22H2	5.0	Five Stars	1	1	It is a good tablet. I like the parental controls.
R1CW426SEZ5QDH	5.0	This is a great Tablet, especially for the price	0	0	This is a great Tablet, especially for the price. We purchased it for our 3 yr old who is not familiar with gadgets and it was very easy for her to use. It was mostly for entertainment on plane rides this summer. I loved that I could download the kindle app and borrow audio books from the library, which she loved! Its very similar to our sons Verizon tablet. Great Purchase!!!

R300D670UKJ2EP	1.0	DO NOT BUY BROKE AFTER 30 MINS	0	0	This is very hard to setup for kids to use and this kids mode that is on it suck you have to download a different one anyways. My son used it for 30 mins and the screen went dark but you could still hear the sound from the movie he was watching. We tried charging it, turning it on and off and just leaving it off screen is still dark. Piece of crap sending back for a refund!
R2PFLD6L5MQ48V	1.0	Would definitely NOT recommend this product	0	0	If I could give no stars I would. I bought this item and followed the directions exactly. Every game my son played would stop working 5 minutes after playing it. Then after having it for a week the charger no longer worked. I exchanged it thinking I may have just received a defective one and the new one would not charge at all. Would definitely NOT recommend this product.
RWZE90WDHS8MN	4.0	I'm happy with the price and the product	0	0	Purchased for my 3 year old, so I was hoping the screen and case would be a little more durable in case of accidental drops, but I'm going to get a screen protector and a hard plastic case to hopefully prevent it from breaking if it gets dropped. I'm happy with the price and the product, so far, and the fact that it has parental controls makes it perfect for little kids.
R1U196S3QWMHZ2	5.0	I was really happy about that	0	0	The delivery was quick, I was really happy about that. I have a new daycare and I decided to get a tablet for my first and so only child. When I presented it, I heard a squeal of joy from this 18 month old. I thought it came with games already on it but it's okay, google has plenty of free games. I am very pleased with this tablet, I wish the sound was a little louder.
R2SBIO3TCWLRXY	1.0	I shouldnt have bought this	0	0	Charger didn't fit properly. Battery wouldn't even charge to 100% after buying a new charger. Slow processing Very fragile even with the protective case. Broke after 2 days Waited to go on a trip to use so I couldn't return. I bought two of these pieces of junk, both had the same problems. Save your money and buy a good kids tablet instead.
R3CZHX15B8WQ1Q	4.0	I really wanted to love it. But...(update)	0	0	Hasn't even been a month and I'm experiencing problems. Either the charger is completely dead, or the tablet itself doesn't want to take a charge. So now I'm contacting customer service to see if things can be worked out before a full refund route gets taken place. It worked great at first, for the price an excellent tablet! We'll see where this rabbit hole goes... Edit: turns out if you encounter this problem there's an alternate way to charge! Mini usb works great for now, if it holds up this is a great product for the money. Expect some lag and occasional hiccups, not exactly mind blowing specs but gets the job done and won't break the bank. My 3 year old is having no trouble operating the kids YouTube.
R2VT9RV8NCVGYU	5.0	Great Tablet. Perfect for what we were looking for	0	0	Great Tablet. Perfect for what we were looking for. My 7 and 5 year old sons love their tablets. They are protected under zoodles Kid Mode so I never have to worry about what they are downloading. There are great parental control features even in the playstore. My kids have as many free apps they want to download that are under the guidelines I am comfortable with.
R5A4FNPJWPNEU	5.0	Zoodles is the greatest	0	0	For a cheaper tablet, it is really great for my 2 year old. For the makers of Zoodles, I give major qudos. This an amazing thing to have where she can't roam around the tablet messing with stuff. I give 5 stars because it keep my baby occupied. I added our wifi to it and have not had a problem. Now my older children who have a more expensive tablet want her tablet.
R219Q89LLWK0BA	2.0	Defective unit; poor packaging	0	0	I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter and though my son liked the features, I had to return it because there was a persistent horizontal line going across the screen. Also, before giving it, I checked inside to make sure everything was there - it was but part of the interior packaging was torn so I had to wonder if this unit had been returned previously.
R19K77XNSLNQ9P	1.0	Not what expected	0	0	Brought this tablet to give to my son on his birthday. He was excited to have his own tablet. However this tablet has too many glitches, every time u try to push a button it opens or closes app, games don't open or just freeze, rebooted this tablet too many times and still works like someone else is controlling it. Overall I am very disappointed in this tablet. What a refund or better tablet that don't freeze or does not open apps.
R1S44MEJU2S21G	1.0	I'll update this review if the replacement works better.	0	0	Worked for 4 days then never turned on again. Couldn't do a hard reset. The tablet wasn't dropped or mistreated in any way. The area near the power button is staying very warm to the touch even though it hasn't been plugged in or turned on for hours. I'm returning it to Amazon and ordering a replacement. I'll update this review if the replacement works better.
R3F252WEUM24MN	4.0	Great tablet for a young child	0	0	I got this tablet for my two year old to play games on. He gets jealous of his older brothers iPad so I figured I'd give this one a go. Works good. Great value. Does just what I intended it to do. We only download apps and let him play with those so we have no issues. I dunno if I would use it for anything more though. Highly recommended for a child to use.
R1XBLG9CFH0A9S	5.0	Very impressed	0	0	I bought this based on reviews and could not be happier. Perfect for my 4 year old or even for me to surf web and read Kindle while relaxing. Only drawback I've found is touchscreen accuracy is slightly off, and it makes a line one the screen when you "drag" something. No biggie for me, she can play games and watch videos, was great on our car trip.

It is made for kids treatment and well protected as long as they leave the cover on. Use caution when plugging it in to charge, it's sometimes difficult to get the little plug that goes in the tablet, must be inserted straight to connect.

I bought the Dragon Touch for my granddaughter and one drop and the screen broke with the kid case on it. It is not a good one. The Amazon Kids edition is built much better and worth the extra $

Bought this thinking it was different but it is the sme tablet, except it comes with a protective shell. The shell is great. The tablet locks up and will not run the preloaded kids app it advertises. Very disappointed.
R2TOI7XE1YDVEE	1.0	Not for children under 10	0	0	Broke within 24 hours. Purchased this for my grandsons 7 th birthday to take on a trip. Within 24 hours the screen was broken and would only show half of screen. He rolled over on it on the floor while playing and it broke. My husband said that's why it was so inexpensive that it was flimsy. Lesson learned. Rated one star as set up was somewhat easy.

First one that was shipped to me ran ok still kinda slow but my daughter dropped it on a table from a short.distance and the lock button completely broke and went inside the tablet.

I put the tablet on the charger for 10 hours as instructed. When I went to turn it on the battery was still dead. I thought it was a bad battery but I decided to troubleshoot. I used the USB wall charger from my cell phone. The tablet charged with my charger but not the one it came with. So, right out of the box I had a faulty charger. The charger it comes with is cheap made and unheard of. Not happy about it but it could have been worse.
R167HCG5JSIW97	5.0	I totally love this tablet	0	0	I totally love this tablet. A few weeks ago I purchased a tablet for my son's birthday but returned it because it didn't meet my expectations. However, this tablet does, it is as advertised, it comes with preloaded games, it is indeed kid savvy (comes in a protective case) which is a plus; the reception is clear and my son loves it...its a keeper!
R3646LJQC8G09N	5.0	Very impressed!!!	2	3	My children can't get enough of this tablet! Its made for adults but has a wonderful app that keeps all of their apps in one area that parents have to put in a pin to get out of. You can have seperate accounts for each child as well. Will be recommending this to anyone who asks!
RFC2J9UYILIGM	1.0	Not User Freindly	0	0	Terrible tablet. Not user friendly, and somewhat slow. I Have spent a week trying to use Zoodles. Every time it says I need to download Adobe Flash Player but I already have it and have used it for other apps. took the company 3 days to respond to my problem but I am pretty sure they are auto bot responses. Not real people. Sending it back today.
R3APUIOS8L0ZY	2.0	My daughters tablet works fine. My sons tablet won't hold a charge	0	0	I bought two of these tablets. One for my two year old son and one for my four year old daughter. My daughters tablet works fine. My sons tablet won't hold a charge. A full charge lasts maybe half an hour. The tablet will also shut itself off about five times within this half hour of life. You are rolling the dice if you buy this tablet........
R10E2D9HBFP3BN	3.0	its a ok tablet... reason for three ...	0	0	its a ok tablet...reason for three stars is that i purposely bought it cause it said that it have zoodles with the preinstalled games for kids which it didn't really have and you actually have to download adobe flash and after trying for a whole day realizing that the tab is not compatible with adobe flash.Which is basically false advertising.

We are using it in our 3 year old classroom for free time and the children love it It is easy to use and turns on very easily.

RBHBFM65OQDHD	2.0	What the heck? ?	0	0	I bought this tablet about 5 weeks ago and it has been played with normal usage and with care. Yesterday I removed the charger after it charging for about 8 hours and it is showing battery is so dead it won't turn on. The charger fits in fine but won't charge it. It worked great until now but I can't believe it only lasted a month. I'm going to try a new charger and hope it works.

A child should be able to play a game without having to disregard some aspects of it b/c it cost money. let a free game be free!

I turned off and back on, I even tried system reboot and reset to factory settings.
R29TRO1AUJWWFU	3.0	It's ok but....	0	0	Too slow for my 19 month old daughter. She's accustomed to my HD Fire tablet and when she started using this one she became frustrated easily and have a meltdown. The apps took too long to load etc. It's a nice looking tablet and good for a child who has not been exposed to fast touch screens, tablets and phones prior to using this.
R1KKX7EIPCW2FQ	5.0	Great Deal!!!	0	0	I absolutely love these little tablets for kids there already pre installed with kids zoodle and I have bought 2 and I plan on to keep buying them till all the kids get one, fyi there's 6 lol oh just an idea ' all of them should come with screen protectors the first one didn't and I thought it did. Now the screen is scratched.
RF2GAOB870HD4	1.0	( He was so happy with this gift	0	0	I purchased this tablet as a gift for my cousin. After two days using it, this piece of junk stopped working. It doesn't charge, and you can't turn it on! All you can do is just trash it! Waste of money. Thank you very much!
R3RDO1WVR0LEQ4	1.0	Nope.	0	0	We've had this tablet for 2 months now and hate it. It worked fine in the beginning but now we have to shut it down every time a video needs to be changed. The touch screen has gone in the crapper. Now looking at the kid's Kindle....I know it's more reliable than this one. The other reviews were the reason I chose this tablet.

Although he takes a million pictures with it,by accident,It still is great for the price. Thank you to the young lady who made the video review about it, that is what sold me and like her I'm not disappointed,The price can't be beat for a starter tablet for the little ones!
RRO00Z35DARE7	5.0	Very easy for him to use and even easier for me ...	0	0	My six year old LOVES this tablet! Very easy for him to use and even easier for me to monitor what he has access to! Very durable as well with the nice soft plastic case. The only down side is when the tablet needs charging the case has to be pulled back to do so because the charger will not go in far enough to connect.
R273ZLVFAC9T35	2.0	not happy	0	0	This was not a great purchase for me. The first one I got same items charger did not work. I was sent a new tablet with charger. The second one same item, the charger works but the tablet is really cheaply made, it is slow and it doesn't keep a charge long at all. I WILL NOT PURCHASE from that particular company again
R1QWMU24UB7HF4	2.0	power button broke in first week	2	3	Daughter barely had it a week and power button jammed and can no longer use it, I didn't purchase the insurance because I figured ah just $50 but encourage you strongly to get the insurance, over all was ok and case it comes in is nice and fits perfectly
R52I0NFRE9X5O	5.0	Thumbs Up for granddaughter and her mom!	0	0	So far, my granddaughter has had her tablet for just a few days and mom loves it, too. Mom says the volume is lower than expected but is clear and protects her little ears from too much noise. I purchased the Hello Kitty Kid Safe Over the Ear Headphone with Volume limiter. My granddaughter absolutely loves her tablet!
R2L6UD40Y4SJXN	1.0	breakable	0	0	I bought this fro my son and he loved it. The problem is that the 2nd week he got it, it broke. He was playing around with my other son and he stepped on it. It had the case and it made a popping sound and the screen cracked. I couldn't find a store to fix it so it became trash. the screen wouldn't work because of it.
RYGE4HRRYV8FL	3.0	Dragon touch pink addition	0	0	Things seem to not work properly on this item 1. The touch screen works only half the time 2. The battery will not charge fully only to 92% 3. Battery life seems way to short compared to the other one we bought runs down in half the time. Please reply back soon with information on how to exchange asap.
RVP6FZYUY89K	1.0	2 DOA and I'm done	0	0	I've received my second defective tablet. The first had a giant line of pixels broken across the LCD panel. The second has a broken G sensor (the screen won't rotate reliably). I'm looking elsewhere this time. I know these are cheap table, but I want cheap-working, not cheap-they-don't-even-have-a-QA-department.
R3SLXSO8RLSFQG	1.0	Pay for what you get.	0	0	Although inexpensive, absolutely terrible product. Power port is a male pin, and this broke on day five and fell inside the tablet. Screen is absolutely horrendous. Even looking at it directly in front of you it has the worst quality of an screen I have ever seen. I knew better. Took a shot and lost. Lesson learned.
R2NC51TX5209EB	2.0	It's very slow. Trying to download some games for ...	0	0	It's very slow. Trying to download some games for the kids and it never will. It connected immediately to my Wi-Fi. Battery went down from 100% to 85% just sitting with nobody using it in about 2 hours. Hope my daughter can download some games on it for the kids or I will be sending it back. Very dissatisfied.
R317HNDOZ18SJ6	5.0	Good tablet for the price	0	0	Good tablet for the price. Especially buying for children under 5 years old. Compared to buying Samsung for kids. You're buying two of these for the price of one of those that basically does about the same thing play. Small kids are not into graphics or speed just as long as it plays. Grand son tested and approved.
RW8PGZMNRP3HV	1.0	This was nice for a week	0	0	This was nice for a week. The screen quit working within a week. A new one was sent. My son was just as excited. The tablet itself looks nice. Attempted to charge the replacement for the first time and the plug didn't fit the port. Now all we get is a red battery with an exclamation point. Don't waste your time.
RHU912RHMG9CA	5.0	It is great quality tablet for the price	0	0	My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He loves watching You Tube and playing games on it. It is great quality tablet for the price. The battery lasts longer than most tablets. I love the protective covering so I don't have to worry about it breaking if my son drops it. I would recommend this tablet for all kids.
R3UKUDI97ZCSYD	5.0	I bought 2 so far and they are great!	0	0	I initially bought 2 tablets for my 2 and 4 year old, but shortly after I purchased 1 my 2 year old put 1 in the bathtub. Without hesitation I purchased another one! It should arrive today! I bought them all seperately just to make sure I would like them, and they are a great price and are a great product so far!
R281ZO3E73PV0R	5.0	Perfect kids tablet for the price!	0	0	Perfect tablet for the price! Its very durable with the cover they send. I had a kindle fire 7 for my kid and hated it! This on the other ha mnd is cheaper, but has the same quality! But don't expect an Ipad though! I love the parental control options it has and you can downlywhat every you want from play store!
R2A5ARBF97L081	5.0	Everything was easy to set up and arrived quickly	0	0	Everything was easy to set up and arrived quickly. My son was so excited and has not put this tablet down since I put it in his hand. Remember to fully charge it the first couple of times. I bought this for an upcoming plane ride cross country. It was recommended by a friend and I am so glad we bought it.
R3EV11IX0P78N3	5.0	This tab is fab!	0	0	This tablet is my most favorite one. It's cheap yet performs like a costly tablet. I've tested out everything and I'm happy with the outcome. Operations are smooth, touch system is really sweet and display is crystal clear. I really do enjoy watching movies and playing games on it. In short, I love this tab!
RU95SZPNKBTBM	1.0	Replacement needed!!	0	0	Tablet won't leave the screen that just says "android" I let it die and tried charging it and turning it on again and it won't turn on still Plus the cover was ripped and it smells absolutely horrible I ordered one of these in the past and had no issues with it. I'd like a replacement.
R1D1QPVD4UZ9IR	4.0	Good cheap tablet for a child to play with	0	0	This is a cheap/slow tablet, but the price point is good, and it's standard Android KitKat. The case is also very nice, for kids. Doesn't have GPS or Bluetooth. Cameras are low res. Couldn't run the "My Little Pony" game. Other than those, no complaints. Netflix, Youtube, Google Earth, all run great.
RXE12303A52QN	1.0	still waiting for exchange.	0	0	Was very disappointed with this particular tablet. From the beginning the touch screen was difficult to operate. Really had to tap hard or repeatedly. Sent it back for an exchange and still waiting for it. I was only notified that it was received. I have twin 2 1/2 year olds that fight over the other one.
R170XT6W9OXZUT	3.0	Would recommend and purchase again.	0	0	Just like most other android tablets but added kid friendly apps. My son is 8 and has had regular tablets that cost more. He likes this just the same but loves the silicon case (he went with the green). The price was much better than the others, though!!!! Plus, the case and screen protector is included! But after just about a month of use, both charging ports are already acting up.
R2I4LW0197JXTU	5.0	My love for the dragon touch	0	0	Omg I bought this for my son for Christmas although he has not touched it yet I when I first opened it it looks exactly the same the picture it's a great product I'm so happy I got this now I jus can't wait until my son opens his present and see his eyes glow love the whole product down to the red case
R30ZMXR0JCN2Y	5.0	Excellent performance!	0	0	I am really impressed by the performance and the working efficiency of this tablet. All the applications run smoothly without any error or problem. I never get bore with it as it is updated with all latest features. It is light in weight but strong at working. I would definitely recommend this tablet.
R2ETAG9ZNXL203	1.0	doesn't hold their interest	0	0	My son just didn't care about it. He played with it for half an hour and never picked it up again. We ended up just getting him his own iphone, since he kept asking to play with ours. That's worked out the best for us so far. I'd recommend doing the same, theirownphone.com is a good place to get one.
R1I9P1825RMP5X	5.0	dragon touch perfect for the 7 year old grandkids	0	0	Bought for granddaughter getting another now for 2nd granddaughter! Works great and wonderful controls to protect kids' was able to get their favorite games fun an the educational ones. One down side, charging isn't as easy as plugging in. You need to wiggle it and make sure it shows charging. Small child will need help.
R1YHSL2NW80DTM	1.0	Do not buy	0	0	This product doesn't even deserve 1 star. You can't load the updates to run you tube and other apps. The play store won't load. It's one thing after another so there's not a whole lot you can do with this. It isn't worth 60 dollars. Do not purchase. And I bought two. Worst purchase I've ever made.
R2ZJYZWCJX551C	5.0	Great tablet for small kids	0	0	My little birthday boy is going to love his new tablet. The case and screen are very child friendly; and the Zoodles app is perfect, not only does it give him fun age appropriate games but it tracks the progress he makes. I also the the restricted user feature. I can't wait to see his face light up.
R1LI1I69Q6L5ZP	5.0	so good! I bought two other tablets for my older ...	0	0	So far, so good! I bought two other tablets for my older sons and this one is way faster then both!! The screen images are bright and all the extras built into the computer are also helpful. I can add to this review once I had more time to explore it. Thanks to the company for a good product :)
R1U5RLMXKE4SMB	4.0	I don't think we've had it more than 5 months so not happy it's already going down hill	0	0	My 3 year old loves his tablet but I'm already getting the "blue" screen so I know it's not going to last much longer. I don't think we've had it more than 5 months so not happy it's already going down hill. Also doesn't turn on every time and I have to play with it to get it on for him.
R3LRKHT47JWKVF	3.0	Below Expectations	0	0	I purchased this for my 3 year old since she loves to play on my iPad. Cons: I'm disappointed with this tablet, the reviews made it sound like a really good tablet but it often freezes on any game that is 3D. Simpler games seem to work fine (most of the time). It is a difficult comparison however, I have a iPad 3rd generation and it's far more advanced than this device and my daughter can tell. She brings the tablet to me every time she plays with it to tell me it's frozen. Pros: -The case is really good and provides great protection, and feels comforatable in the hand -The slow loading and frequent freezing makes my 3 year old bored with it and moves onto other more productive activities before her time limit is even up -Cheap price
R1OJJC6RGOWR3C	5.0	Satisfied purchase!	0	0	I bought this tablet on demand by my son. He is 12 years old and has keen interest in getting in contact with newest technologies. I was worried about him getting close to harmful websites but all my worries were for nothing. It is the best tablet in all aspects and I am satisfied to purchase it.
RZF66WPULEQ95	5.0	No worries.	0	0	This tablet is actually designed for kids at play. I bought this tablet so that my daughter would spend quality time while having fun. It is user friendly and creates a very learning environment when used. I am glad to chose this tablet of all others. I have no worries when she using this tablet.
R13UDA6W7ZOPM0	4.0	This is a good tablet for the price	0	0	This is a good tablet for the price, however; the battery runs low quickly. It probably lasts 3 hours on a full charge, and the screen scratches easily, so I recommend purchasing a screen protector. However, I bought it for my young son and his attention span is really short, so it works for him.
R2RKUWAY9R3YZY	5.0	Great tablet for kids!	0	0	Just received this tablet today I bought for my son for Christmas have been working on setting it up for him I downloaded the kids zone app and it allows me to lock it in kids zone and he can only go to the apps I provide for him very good quality case and tablet in my opinion for my 2 year old
R1VH46V1IU27CS	5.0	The best tablet for kids	0	0	Finding the right tablet for kids can be hard. But this tablet has the features that I’ve been looking for suited for their age; it has kid proof case which is best for their small hands and it protect the tablet from big drops. The processor is fast and can handle game and task with no sweat.
RZWHN442SOE9F	3.0	It is very sturdy and I am sure will survive many a dropping ...	1	2	My son is thrilled with it and feels so grown up to have his own tablet for 3rd grade. It is very sturdy and I am sure will survive many a dropping and probably even if it were stepped on or sat on would be just fine. The case is great and screen cover is helpful. What made it okay and not good or great for me was the set up was a bit confusing and frustrating for me. Much more difficult to set up than my Kindle or a new computer but I finally figured it out. I read some reviews before purchasing stating that this tablet could stream Netflix. Well, I am not sure but when I tried it gave a message stating that in order to use this app it would need to update the browser giving me a number of unfamiliar choices and to download it. I did not feel comfortable downloading it. Also, when installing Zoodles, it required in the directions to enable downloads from unknown sources. I did download Firefox and Zoodles after changing the download settings as stated in the directions. The tablet then made me verify that I was an adult and checkbox sign a waiver that I was solely responsible for harmful downloads damaging the device and was I sure I wanted to continue. I felt I had no choice but to waive any manufacturer warranty in order to use the "pre-loaded" apps. I am always nervous about downloading things regardless due to I am not sure this device has any antivirus software. I did not download a new browser for Netflix for fear that it would make the device inoperable and therefore a waste of my money. I have now changed the settings back to only download from trusted sources but the waiver has been signed. I sure hope it doesn't break down on me any time soon because if it does, I will feel jipped. In addition, the Zoodles app is very limited in free selections and repeatedly asks me to sign up for the 4.95 monthly upgrade to full version. The app states when downloading that it does have in-app purchasing on the device so if I were to upgrade and put in my credit card info, I am sure it would become another money pit so I opted to just keep the limited free version for now. My son does love his new tablet and enjoys playing the Zoodles games and videos that are available for free. If you are going to purchase this tablet, you may want to research what safe apps you want to download and have access to a computer that you can use to troubleshoot the device for installing the apps.
R21VUEE4CYQ3OB	5.0	very impressed with the speed of the software and its easy to use	0	0	I bought it for my son who is 4 years old he loves it, decent battery life considering he plays with it for at least 2hrs straight, very impressed with the speed of the software and its easy to use. It comes with a thick rubber case which makes me feel a lot more comfortable. Worth the price.

The first one screen broke within two weeks . the second one won't charge at all now. So yeah its a waste my twins are almost 6 and take good care of their electronics. But this right here is a no no @!
RNZ20GSWTFOXQ	5.0	I like it because the Zoodle app is just for her ...	0	0	My two year old Grand-daughter just loves it. I like it because the Zoodle app is just for her age group. She has been playing on her father's ipod and when she opened it she was so excited and she knows more about it then I do. It is great. The rubber case is just what is needed on it.
R3M6BAL2UWC4LB	5.0	Quad Core!!! Need I say more?	0	0	This thing is perfect for my 7 year old daughter, or frankly for anyone wanting a powerful and cheap android tablet. This thing is very snappy. Compared to my 2 year old $230 Nexus 7" tablet, night and day difference. This Dragon Touch makes me jealous of my little girls tablet. LOL
RJ19BUFHX2DKO	1.0	Be careful	0	0	Ordered this for my niece for her birthday payed extra shipping to receive in time for her party didn't receive it until the following Monday!! Once I got it to her it didn't work it wouldn't even turn on left it on the charger for 2 days finally got it to turn on but still wouldn't work!!
R1WLPJNOFN8VE1	5.0	kids tablet purchase & product experience	0	0	Excellent delivery time & service! Pleased with product! My 6 yr old daughter absolutely loves it! Only thing is some games don't seem to play on Zoodles...perhaps it is something I'm not doing properly. Other than that, purchase experience & product was above my expectations!!!
R2SZNKK1QI4Q2E	2.0	Waste of money	0	0	UPDATE: We've used this less than a dozen times and my toddler is never unsupervised with it. It freezes often, is glitchy, and now it won't even boot up. Don't bother with this one. Waste of money. It's not a iPad but it does it's job. I actually mostly use it to read, but I have some toddler apps downloaded as well. They work well for the most part, although it does sometimes freeze or close the app. It's not often enough to be a huge annoyance, though. All in all, it's fine.

It came right on schedule, was easy to set up and we are generally pleased with it. The only criticism I have is the battery doesn't last long. It went from 100% charged to 35% in a short time, less than an hour of constant usage.
R2PZ6COLR9RXKM	4.0	Dragon Touch tablet	0	0	Nice tablet, well priced for the kids. Only issue was the tablets charging port for the wall charger. First tablet failed, charging port shorted out. Tablet was quickly replaced by the seller with absolutely no hassle. Zoodles is a great program for tracking kid friendly content.
R3FBVPA1TY7RWQ	5.0	Good Value and Does the Job	0	0	I bought this for my 7 year grandson. From a adult view, the battery life is ok but the recharge time is a bit slow. The resolution isn't all that great but... for what it cost it works, it fits the bill =) Good enough for a starter computer... He loves it and that's what counts...
R7QU32DR4CAEP	5.0	Great tablet...one complaint	0	0	So far my daughter loves this tablet! It was very easy to set up...only took about 5 minutes. The response time on this tablet is quick. The battery last pretty long too. My ONLY complaint is the silicone cover...it needs to be propped up on something so my daughter can watch it.
RTU1G9IURQ6JV	1.0	Very disappointed with all the electronic purchases I made through Amazon	0	0	Very disappointed with all the electronic purchases I made through Amazon. Not just the Dragon touch 7" but the other three 7 inch tablets and the 10 Inch tablet. All of them were broken within 2 weeks of recieveing them. Wont be ordering these again, at least not from here
R3NKW0CKD8NIWX	5.0	Great tablet for little kids!!	0	0	Really like this tablet. Was looking for a tablet not just for myself, but also for my kids to quit messing with my phone. So glad to get this tablet. My kids can play with learning games to a certain time. And I can control what they watch too. Very happy with this tablet.
R219UW1ECUFMUM	2.0	Don't waste your money!	0	0	I bought 2 of these tablets in blue for my twins, which I ended up returning. Although the product was as described it was just lacking in quality overall. The software was slow, the screen froze frequently, battery life lasted an hour tops, and it took 24 hours just to charge.
R3TX33TWRN7AXM	5.0	Great tablet for my little one	0	0	Bought this tablet for my 2 1/2 year old son. He loves it! Excellent value, good long battery life. I bearly had to show him how to operate it before he was off and running. He wakes up ready to play on it. Takes very little time to recharge. Will recommend 5 to my friends.
R15R3L74FEDFXW	5.0	love!	0	0	I absolutely love this! Bought it for my daycare kids but I've been using it all afternoon. Does anything a bigger tablet does!! Definitely need to buy some sort of speakers for it as it isn't very loud. I ordered one that's a speaker and stand! Can't wait till it arrives!!
RAJJPDJHU09GN	4.0	Great tablet for the price	0	0	Great tablet for the price. It's not an iPad, but a good option for a value priced android tablet for kids. My 7 and 9 year old enjoy using it. There is a fee to get the most out of zoodles the parental control software. The complaint is that the battery life is terrible.
RCK2FPECPRMDI	3.0	So Far So Good...	0	0	I received the tablet I ordered for my 2 1/2 year old daughter in a timely fashion. I have only used the tablet for less then 20 minutes but so far it seems to be working well. Also, I am happy that I received exactly what I ordered within the time frame that was promised :)
R2L9IHRMBR1N9X	4.0	dragon touch review	0	0	We brought this for our kids for Christmas. I done some exploring and uploaded some games. I think they are really going to like it. The only problem I see is you have to pay for the kids mode if you are wanting to manage the time limit and violence but otherwise I like it.
R12C9KS1SFBK3A	5.0	This is a perfect tablet for a child	0	0	My niece wanted this for her 7 year old son. This is a perfect tablet for a child. We got his for him for his Easter Basket and sometimes we have to pry it out of his hands!!! He has even dropped it a few times and been able to pick it right up and keep playing!!!
RMUNBI8TLIPI9	5.0	Spent nearly $90 that time and just $60 for the Dragon Touch with all the same features and speed but better value.	0	0	Met my quality expectations and my daughter loves it. Bought a different tablet for her last year on her birthday which died before the year warranty was up. Spent nearly $90 that time and just $60 for the Dragon Touch with all the same features and speed but better value.
R3DJQTMQR2ZM8S	4.0	Overall a pretty good deal	0	0	Overall a pretty good deal. I bought it for a long, overseas trip and loaded it with apps my kids use on our tablet or my phone. They (6 & 10) loved it. But as others have said, the battery life is SHORT. Also plan on buying a miniSD card or flash drive for extra memory.
R1LD56LOGK2MVS	5.0	it's sturdy and well made	0	0	I bought this for my young nephew. He really is too young for it but he can *play* some of the games and watch movies. It won't be long before he plays with it for real, kids are so electronics savvy these days. It is made for children, it's sturdy and well made.
R3MA4ST3J8P28W	1.0	I am very disappointed with this tablet	0	0	I am very disappointed with this tablet. I bought this for my son and not even 3 months later the plug is bent and the tablet won't work. We purchased the cover for the tablet and everything. Apparently now we can't even return or exchange the product. Very dissatisfied.
R1WCRICXDA861S	1.0	Easy to use	0	0	Bought it for my son's birthday based on a lot of positive review. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!! The on/off button got stuck after 4 days. If I could I would've given it a half of a star. The tablet itself was OK. Easy to use, looked OK, but wasn't made for short, chubby fingers.

Love being able to put it on kids mode as well so that I don't have to worry about them downloading stuff that they aren't supposed to. Love the case as well, very durable and really protects the tablet.

I would have given it a higher rating but the only thing wrong with it is the power button broke and the tablet case cracked even with the silicone case. I will be contacting the company to see what i can do to get it fixed.
RVC2089SBQD9J	1.0	WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!	0	0	Dragon Touch DOES NOT LIVE UP TO WHAT THEY ADVERTISE. I would STRONGLY AVOID buying anything from them as quad core is more of single core. runs very slow if more than 1 app is open, and video playback is very poor. the camera is also very poor. Buy at your own risk.
R1MAIYQ5V863OI	1.0	Needs a real home button for small kids to know how to use	0	0	-Screen quality and viewing angles are horrible. -Slow charging. -The biggest issue is it doesn't have a phyisical home button which makes it diffuclt for kids under 7 to use. Its not easy to teach a 3 or 4 year old how to swipe up to press the home button.
RCH5WY7MXDSZD	5.0	Worth Every Dollar	0	0	I love love loveee this tablet. This is the second tablet I've purchased for my daughter and she loves it as much as I do. The interface is easy to use and it was already loaded with her favorite App. I only wish I bought this one first instead of that silly Nobis.

RY7PJVZJ6C4LS	1.0	Quit charging after about a week!	0	0	We just got these yesterday but so far we've been very pleased. Our 5 year old daughter loves it and is enjoying playing/watching on it. She (&we) also love that it comes with the pink rubbery case. So far it's been great. I'll post an update if anything changes. ********After about a week of owning these (we bought 2), they BOTH quit charging! We would plug them in and NOTHING. We switched outlets, plugs, interchanged them, etc. and NEITHER worked! SENT BACK!
R2YARLG8999RZ	3.0	It's Okay	0	0	Just received it today, and it seems okay. Still trying to figure it out, and get it set up for my 6 year old son. It does come with a screen protector already on it, which is a bonus. Will leave another feedback when we get it going and have used it for a week. New Review (08/21/2015) Returning due to malfunction. Was second one, not very happy. Screen blacked out and then wouldn't shut off with flickering on screen.
R2GEUTRCFAZ4XH	1.0	Nope nope nope	0	0	Received this item today, my 3 year old was beyond excited to set it up but wen I took the thing out of the box it doesn't even turn on, major let down for my son's birthday and a super waste of my money for faster shipping just to end up with a broken tablet!!

Maybe something is running in the background and I haven't found it yet, but the tablet begins dropping very quickly, and my daughter is charging it after being on it only about half an hour.
R2RY7J1RJKJ625	4.0	Good tablet compared to it is price	0	0	I like the tablet it is the right size for my 2 years old son with a great protecting cover. The parent control feature is nice. The only downsize is the screen quality is not the best, has a lot of glare. But overall it is a good product compared to it's price.
RSEPV4RG1X4B9	1.0	Autism disappointed 6 year old	0	0	I bought this for my autistic grandson on October13 by November 3rd the battery stopped recharging. Can not even use it while it is plugged in.

Battery life is horrible I mean horrible and on top of that they are slow but all that I expected out of a cheap kids tablet but its not a kids tablet navigating this tablet is to complicated for kids
R3BAH0QPRJXCA1	5.0	Awesome!!!!!!!	0	0	I love it, my kids absolutley adore it! Have had about a few hours now and they have not put it down. Only down is camera resolution is ok, but figured the kids are not going to be taking pictures so its no big deal! Perfect for our 14 hour flight next month!!!
R3VFQFKNTEXSFF	5.0	definately!!	0	0	Love it. Bought 2. One for each kid. They are easy to use. Very responsive to touch. Have had for a couple months now. We love. I also love the fact the cover easily comes off for when my oldest thinks it looks to childish. Very decent quality. Would buy again.

The unit has not been able to play a video to date as it keeps buffering and sticking. It works well for going on amazon or emails but it has not fulfilled the purpose I got it for.
R139DPX0HIRRF6	1.0	Horrible Tablet.	0	0	Screen is horrible, you can't see anything. Right out of the box the tablet didn't work. It wouldn't let you go to the app store at all. The case is not a protective one at all. The battery died in a couple hours without even being used. Do not buy this tablet
R3G9OZ2WOXFGKW	1.0	Don't buy, trust me!!	0	0	Crap. Will not charge. We've only had it 3 months and and after the first 30 days or so it just quit charging. If it does get a full charge it only lasts an hour. Very disappointed! And so is my daughter who got this for her birthday and can never play on it.

Screen froze and it is unusable. Lasted 2 months. This is the 2nd android tablet to give us trouble. Moving on to Apple. You get what you pay for.
RUDWJHTTLPRVN	5.0	Tons of pre-installed apps	0	0	The thing I love about this tablet is its very child friendly. It has thick silicone case and padding which helps protecting the case, it has pre-installed games that can entertain my kids for hours and very affordable. For its price this product is a steal.
R2WUN7M1DGMA3S	1.0	Very slow with a poor quality screen (when it was actually working)	0	0	Piece of junk, the on button broke with about a month of use. Very slow with a poor quality screen (when it was actually working). The kid's interface is terrible. Spend a few more bucks on something that won't be a horrible disappointment for your child.
R2K7JJJ692FL9A	3.0	Okay but slow	0	0	I give it 3 stars simply because even on high speed internet it moved pretty slow.. The case was awesome when it was dropped off the couch or something it just bounced no hard falls.. I recommend a screen protector and it was an awesome size my baby loves it
R17OLUUA7NQ8UO	5.0	Tons of pre-installed apps	0	0	The thing I love about this tablet is its very child friendly.

R3EZKM11FLDS27	1.0	Don't buy this piece of junk	0	0	I had the tablet for almost four months before the camera broke and a part of the screen stop responding to touch. I can't get a replacement since the company has 90 day warranty and I am already past the 90 days. I just wasted money on this piece of crap.
R2QS4C4JT9FNK2	5.0	Very good for the money!	1	2	So I would like to clear up some misconceptions about this tablet....I purchased it for a special needs child that is 15 (has about a 4 year old mentality) he is fairly tablet saavy because of school but needs something simple for educational play. I read a lot of reviews that seemed to be negative and this tablet blew those all to shame. It is NOT an iPad or other high end device but it is quick and efficient, wifi connected beautifully and I downloaded about 25 games/apps with no problem. The screen is clear and easy to read and as with most tablets I've seen is a little difficult in sunlight or at angle to view properly but never the less was very good. The speakers are good, I was able to turn them up and sound quality was fair. The camera was as expected, not photographer quality but very good none the less. It came about 85% charged and is down to about 68% after downloading the games/apps and playing for about 2 hours. The silicone case fits very snug and makes the tablet seem very substantial, without the case it is very trim but heavy enough to seem durable. No tablet is kid proof ( a table corner or stairs will kill em all) but I tested it by dropping it a few times and it survived perfectly. It came with a screen protector that is sufficient but the child that will be using this has been taught to take care of his toys so if your child has the same mindset it should be fine. All in all its a great product for a budget and would be great as a learning toy or entertainment tablet.
R1CIMFREZGUU0B	5.0	Must buy!	0	0	This tablet is well made and it's got everything you could ask for in an Android tablet. It has extensive built in functions and wide range of space makes it a lot more easier to have all my favorite applications. This is the best tablet I ever experienced!
R150QA8GI5SG2S	5.0	Silicone protected	0	0	This would be the best tablet for my 6 year old toddler, because of its kid’s proof case. It’s durable and lightweight and I don’t have to worry even if it falls because its silicone protected. It has also has educational games that very good for my child.
R2APURD2GMGW7K	4.0	Good little tablet for kids	0	0	Seems to be a pretty good tablet for small children. It does load kinda slow but seems to be fine for my toddlers. The case it comes with is great and will protect it from being dropped and abused by small children. Setting up kide mode was quick and easy.
R1VDY3N3CVUL1S	5.0	Its great	0	0	This was actually a replacement to the one initially purchased that malfunctioned. The tablet is great and when i needed it replaced customer service we really nice about and i received the replacement in 2 days. My daughter loves it and I can use it too.
R8CW55GBJLTZO	1.0	Not recommended. Save your money.	0	0	Very disappointed. We've only had this slow running slow loading no directions tablet for a month.

RJ6ABJ20D5F4V	5.0	PERFECT FOR A 6 YEAR OLD	0	0	A perfect tablet for a 6 year old. I got this for my nephew to download games and play on it, I also hope he uses the other tools as well. But for the price if he just wants to download games and leave auntie's phone alone, I AM DOWN WITH THIS TABLET.

RZM5E8WJWYMDG	4.0	Worth the money	0	0	Pretty decent tablet for kids. Cons: battery life is low...needs recharging every few hours...and the picture quality for both the cameras but my kids don't seem to mind n it works fine for Skype so all in all for the price, it's worth the while...
RVV1NNWUD2AAV	4.0	great for thw munchins in your life	0	0	Great tablet for kids. Inexpensive and comes with a serious case. The case is super thick.

RRDB69IBUUF6V	1.0	Dont buy it	0	0	Dont buy this. You have to purchase a mo membership just to edit/change parental settings or block sites on a tablet marketed for children.

R1QOHEKXFNU50Z	2.0	Not very durable for young children.	0	0	It was a good tablet but it only took my 3 year old grandson 2 weeks to dent the touch screen so that it no longer worked. If the cover had been harder to get off it might still be working. Very easy for child To remove the sturdy cover.

The only complaint is that she thinks the protective case is to big. I think it is just fine and offers good protection against whatever she can do to it.
R16IQIOAGEZ2IY	5.0	awesome if you tweak it a bit	1	2	I received this product today and the first thing I did was try out the zoodles to test if it was a good app. I hated it and I actually deleted all of the apps which is very easy to do. I could not figure out zoodle so I knew my daughter wouldn't. It took me a good 30mins to delete all the apps and set it up for my daughter who is 4. I got this so she could play her games and not steal my kindle or my husband's ipad all day. Now I would say out of the box I would give it 2 stars with the zoodles app and all the crap a kid doesn't need on a tablet. But once you delete all that you have plenty of room to put whatever you want on it with Google play. So I give it 5 stars after you delete what you don t want on there and with the case and charger. It is well worth the $50 and works great. I had no problem with wireless either which was a big deal on some of the reviews or any of the games I just had to update my Google play and all the games and disney junior etc works great. I highly recommend this tablet if you know how to work a droid and fiddle with it a bit to get it to your liking it's awesome for the price.
R2E2ESG9RWJY0N	4.0	Not a bad tablet	0	0	Not a bad tablet for a kid. My 4 year old has used it for months and it is still running well. Plays games and allows him to watch Netflix. That is helpful when Mom and Dad want to use the TV.

R1KV77GAPZBG1H	1.0	DISAPPOINTED	0	0	This tablet is not worth the money I paid . It's not like a touch screen that you can easily slide finger or tap keys.

I'm still trying to figure out how to transfer the apps that i downloaded from Google play store to Zoodle parent mode. I'm getting an error message on one of the tablets whenever i try to update the apps. Error 194.

R2KLFO4GXNWAIB	3.0	It's okay for the price.	1	2	It's okay for the price. I hate that it turns off everytime the backlight kicks off. You can't just turn it on and unlock it like normal tablets and phones. You have to start it back up everytime it the screen sleeps. Very annoying especially since I got it for my daughter. It really wouldn't even be too bad having to do this if you didn't have to hold the power button for a long time at least three times for it to turn on. The picture quality is excellent, the sound is great, the camera's are both good. It charges fast and with the brightness low it has a decent battery life. The volume keys are in a perfect spot and the screen controls are prime for kids. If it didn't turn off after only a few minutes of not being in use it would be 5 stars easy from me.

R3VDSIS1LY1VO0	4.0	Comes as a 1-star; can become a 4-star in about 30 minutes	4	7	 Note: the video and the review below are from my review of the Pink version of this, but it is exactly the same tablet with a different-colored case. Any photos mentioned below are in that review (it's not easy adding photos after you've added video, and there are only so many hoops I'll jump through). I'm including this here because I think it's important for potential owners to realize that this has issues out of the box - significant issues - but that they are almost all easily resolved in less than 30 minutes. It's the time-price you pay for the low cost of this tablet. ----------------------- *** PLEASE NOTE THAT THE VIDEO REVIEW IS *AFTER* I DID THE MODIFICATIONS DESCRIBED BELOW - IT DOES *NOT* WORK LIKE THAT OUT OF THE BOX *** *** PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT YOU *NEED* TO INVEST ABOUT HALF AN HOUR IN SETTING THIS UP PROPERLY; IT IS USELESS OUT OF THE BOX (SEE BELOW) *** I want to say right off the bat that I received a free sample for evaluation. As a result of that, though, I did some things with this that I might have been afraid to do had I bought it, so allow me to be your guinea pig. You'll note that I gave it four stars. I believe it deserves those stars, but not out of the box. You'll need to tinker a bit. I'll tell you what issues I had with it as-sold, and how I fixed them, and as a result why I think it's a four-star purchase, given the price. Note the "given the price" bit, because otherwise, you should buy the FireHD Kids Edition Tablet. Of course, it's almost *three times as expensive* (give or take, depending on screen size and such). My co-worker has one for his son, I've played with it, and it is noticeably better than this tablet in every category... unless you absolutely must have Play Store access (which is a nice thing, don't get me wrong, and which the Kindles don't have). But, again, it's *much* more expensive, and you'll likely looking at this because you don't have $150+ sitting around to spend on a tablet for your young child/grandchild/favored pet. So let's see how this can work for you. Truly, it can. You'll just need to do a few things. First, let's tear it down before we build it back up, shall we? There are some problems with this, and you can't fix all of them. Trust me, though, in the end, we'll see the (four) stars shine. But there's a storm to deal with before then. *** Please understand that I do think this is a good tablet, once "fixed", but there are a lot of initial issues, and you should be aware of them. I apologize for the length of text below, but I think it's important. *** * Issue #1: THE INCLUDED CHILDREN'S SOFTWARE IS ATROCIOUS. I cannot even adequately describe how bad it is, but I'll try. *THIS IS THE REASON YOU BOUGHT THIS TABLET* and it is horrifically, unusably, unforgivably bad. It's called Zoodles. You should not use it. First, after turning on WiFi (because - see below - it doesn't come enabled), you will go to the Applications Viewer (the icon to touch looks like two rows of three dots each in a circle on the middle of the bottom of the screen) and open the Parent Dashboard app. How did you know to do so? Answer: you didn't. Anyway, it'll ask for your birth year. Guess what? This is the PIN to keep kids from using other apps, and when you need to enter it in any of the Zoodles apps, it asks you specifically for "your birth year", not "your PIN", so if your kid knows when you were born, the jig is up. Of course, you can enter a random PIN anyway, but it doesn't tell you the birth year will be used as a PIN or that it'll be referred to as your birth year. Also, your PIN has to be a reasonable birth year (example: 5612 didn't work). So, so, *so* bad. Next, it'll ask for an email. Use a dummy one (see below). Then, it'll try to sell you on the $5/month premium package, which isn't included, obviously. Without it, there's not a lot you can do to restrict how your child uses the tablet. Then it'll tell you you need to install Flash Player. Flash Player was a useful thing, and the Internet would have died without it, perhaps, but it's no longer part of Android, and these games won't run unless you download a version of Flash Player. It'll tell you that, and it'll tell you to go into Settings->Security and enable the "Unknown Sources" check box, which will warn you not to do that, but the instructions tell you to check it anyway. If you know what you're doing, that's fine, but it's a terrible thing to tell people to do in general. Anyway... while I didn't spend *too* long on it, it didn't work for me, even following the steps, and I'm quite tech savvy. Maybe I missed a step. The point is: this should have been included in the software shipped with this tablet if it is essential to using kid's mode - and it is. So, let's say that, like me, you couldn't get it installed. In that case, Zoodles is basically worthless. The "games"? They're all YouTube videos. Yay. The art app? Good luck drawing with it: not all the touches register, so... kids will get annoyed. There are books to read, and you can record yourself reading them in a video, but... you're using the low-quality cameras to do so, and as a result I can't recommend that. You can send mail if you set it up, supposedly, but... look, the point is, this is a train wreck. It's an abomination. It is unusable. But... see below. We can fix this. It's just unfortunate that we have to. * Issue #2: Non-standard power cable. This is borderline unacceptable - the tablet *has* a micro USB port, so you'd think it could be charged with a ubiquitous USB charger, but instead it comes with a proprietary cable that has a small, thin tip (prone to breaking, I'd think). Furthermore, the charger doesn't plug all the way it - it protrudes maybe ~1/5" (~0.5cm) from the charging port. Fortunately, the silicone bumper case hides all that and also helps protect the plug, so this is all more of an inconvenience than a deal breaker. The biggest issue with it is that you'll need to get an AC inverter (like, say, this) for your car if you want to bring this anywhere and expect it to last more than a few hours. *EXCEPT*... late-breaking news: YOU CAN CHARGE IT WITH THE MICRO USB PORT. I *just* discovered this in a "what the heck, I'll just try it" moment (again, because I didn't pay for it, so I can take the risks for you). Yes, you can charge it like any other micro USB device. It appears it takes longer, and maybe it's charging at 500mA instead of the 2A the charger provides (despite me using a 2.4A-capable micro USB charger), but I have no idea why they don't mention this. It means you can charge it like other devices and can still use it if the proprietary cable breaks. * Issue #3: The user manual. It is really, really, *really* out of date. It mentions the Android Market. That's what Google Play Store used to be called *over three years ago*. It shows screen renderings of earlier, pre-Android 4.4 (pre-Android 4.x, it seems) screens. So, yes, it's sort of useful, maybe, but not so much. You're as likely to find bad info here as good. I'd ignore it. Let me (and, of course, the Internet) be your guide. * Issue #4: The initial way it comes set up (aside from the terrible kid's software). When you turn it on, the home screen has no apps and WiFi is not enabled. If you don't know your way around Android, you're sort of out of luck here. Yes, you can look at the user manual, and, if you really look hard, you can decipher how to enable WiFi, but it's not apparent. Again, let me be your guide. * Issue #5: The cameras are identical, and *really* low quality. I've attached some photos. The ones of the box this came in were taken by the front and back cameras. Doesn't really matter which is which - they seem to take identical photos. Also, they are saved as 1600x1200 resolution images. They are *not* that good. They are *maybe* 640x480 (but muddled), blown up to fit the larger size. Small kids won't mind. Everyone else probably will. There's an option in the camera app to use the lower resolution. Do so - the larger resolution takes up more space but provides zero extra actual image precision. * Issue #6: The touch screen has a ~1/2" x ~1/2" (~1cm x ~1cm) square in the upper right corner that doesn't accept touch input. I used the built-in developer mode as well as a free app to verify this: it just doesn't register touches there. Sadly, that's where a lot of close/search/menu items are. Solution: rotate it 180° so the bottom left becomes the upper right, and it'll work for you. But you shouldn't have to do that. * Issue #7: The screen is horrible off-axis. Horrible. Dead-on, it's actually pretty good, color wise. I've attached a photo of my awesome Pacific Rim Jaeger (the Gipsy Danger... and no, it isn't "Gypsy") holding it, and you can see the colors well. Note that the moire pattern is an artifact of taking the photo - the colors are solid. But move it even a little - and I'm talking 5 degrees - and it is much, much worse. This tablet could be shared by two side-by-side kids only if they're small enough not to care that it looks the way it will to at least one of them. Speaking of screens: one of the photos shows an HDMI port. This doesn't actually have one (but it's not mentioned, either... I think it's just a photo of a different version). * Issue #8: Headphones are essentially required. Yes, it has a speaker, and yes, you can hear it, but in any real-world environment, it's likely not loud enough. Maybe it is, but I can assure you this won't blow your eardrums. So maybe that's a plus. * Issue #9 Developer mode is enabled. This isn't a *huge* deal, but it's something that typically only developers use, and it can mess up your device if not used properly (example: tell it to use the ART runtime instead of Dalvik - just one little checkbox tiny fingers could find! - and it'll brick the tablet). There is no reason for this to be the case. ----------------- So... how do we fix this? Because, right now, it's looking like 1 star. A complete waste. A call to return it to Amazon. Crying children. Teeth being gnashed. Yelling. Questions of "how did my life end up here?" Let me help. I'm going to step through this from the very beginning. To do that, I'm going to factory-reset my tablet. I'll tell you how to do that, too, in case you ever need to (please note that you DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS if you just opened the tablet and likely not even if you're played with it a lot; I'm just telling you how, just in case): Factory Reset directions: * If your tablet *isn't* unusable, make sure it's on, then press and hold the power button long enough to see the Power Off/Reboot/Silent mode screen, then click Reboot and say OK (if your tablet *is* unusable, press and hold the power button until it starts to reboot, or, if it's off, just long enough to get it started powering on). IMMEDIATELY press AND HOLD *both* volume buttons until you see the Dragon Touch image show up, blink, and be replaced by a screen with the Bugdroid (little green Android guy) image in the background and some text in the foreground. THIS MIGHT TAKE 15 SECONDS OR SO. KEEP THOSE BUTTONS HELD. STAY ON TARGET. If nothing appears for 20 seconds, it probably isn't powering on, so try again. They key is to get those volume buttons down before it starts to boot, immediately after it goes to power on and before you can see anything on the screen. * Once you see Bugdroid, use the Volume Down button to scroll to "wipe data/factory reset" (you can also use Volume Up to scroll up if you go past it), then click the Power button to select it. * On the next screen, again use the Volume Down button to go to "Yes -- delete all user data" and use the Power button to select it. * When that's done (maybe 10 seconds or so), "reboot system now" will be selected - press the Power button to do so. Wait for it to reboot. Starting from the beginning (upon opening the box or after resetting... modify as appropriate if you've already used it a bit): * You'll be greeted with the initial colors-and-butterflies screen. If you powered on and walked away, you might need to unlock it - just put your finger on the lock in the circle and drag it to the "unlocked" icon. If the screen ever goes black, click the power button and do this again. * You'll then be told to make yourself at home... just click "OK". This might not happen for tablets right out of the box, but it will for factory reset tablets. * At some point now or soon, you might be asked if you want to share your location. Do as you wish. * You'll see a little gear icon on the bottom left, next to the camera icon. Click it. It takes you to Settings. Note that you can also slide a finger down onto the screen (from the very top) on the right side, and you'll see the Settings gear there, too. I mention this because that gear in the tray that you likely just clicked can be moved. * You'll see WiFi is off - it's there on the upper left. Click (or slide) it to on. You'll see available WiFi hotspots. Hopefully you'll know one of them. Click it, enter the password, and log in. Advanced users will know how to do other things, but most will click and log in. * While still in Settings - or once back there - scroll down on the left to "Apps" and click it. On the right, you'll now see the downloaded apps that came with this. For each of them: click it, then on the next screen click "Uninstall", then click OK. You don't need them. Removing them will free up space and memory. Once each is done, move to the next (it might not disappear until you've clicked the next thing). There are likely three altogether. If things seem to freeze, click something other than Apps on the left, then click back. * Next, use your finger and slide the right side over from "Downloaded" to "Running" (just drag your finger to the left). Click on Kid Mode and click Stop. Say OK when it asks. Why do this? It removes some strain from the system, since you won't be using it. * Next, slide over to "All" from "Running" (with your finger, like before). In there, for each of the following, click the app, then click "Force Stop" (if available) and "OK", then "Disable" and say OK, then click the back arrow on the bottom of the screen (2nd from the right, next to the volume-up icon). This will free up system resources BUT THEY ALL SEEM TO COME BACK ON A REBOOT. Note this, because you'll need to do this the next time you reboot, probably, to save on resources. Anyway, those unneeded apps include Browser, Email (unless you want email on this), Exchange Services, Kid Mode, Sound Recorder (unless you want that), and Zoodles Game Player. Others, maybe, but do NOT do this with any apps that show the green Android guy. * You might want to move down to Developer options, click on it, and slide the main switch to "Off" - there is no reason to have this on for 99% of the people who will buy this tablet. * Now that you're done with that, hit the Home icon (center, bottom) and get out of Settings. * Now is a good time to learn how to get applications out of memory, since you have so little. Click the Recent Apps icon (bottom, second from left, looks like one rectangle in front of another), then you'll see Settings. Touch it briefly and "flick it" up - you'll just land a finger on it and swipe up; you won't touch it for more than a brief moment. Remember how to do this, because you should frequently clear out apps in memory that you aren't using. You don't *have* to, but it'll help on this tablet to do so. * Let's clear away some apps from the dock/tray. Note: any apps you see on the home screen aren't actually the apps, they're just a link to the app. Deleting these won't delete the apps, it'll just remove the link. You can easily replace them if you change your mind. Anyway, let's say you don't need your child messing around with the File Manager - it's the thing that looks like a filing cabinet. Touch the icon and, while keeping your finger on it, drag it to the `x' that'll appear with "Remove" next to it at the top of the screen. Poof! Gone. Do that with other things you don't want your kids to use. It's not like they can't get to them via the Applications View icon (the dots in the circle), but at least it's less easy to do so. * You can open the Applications View (click that icon) and drag icons from there to the home screen(s) to place links there. You can drag them to the screens themselves, or, for a limited number of them, to the tray at the bottom. The tray stays in place when you slide between home screens. This is standard Android stuff. You can read about it elsewhere. * Now let's add some apps. Click on the Play Store icon (either on the tray or, if you removed it, in the Applications View). It'll ask you for your Google account. STRONG ADVICE: make a new one unless you're positive you want to use yours. It can be anything you want, just don't forget the account name or password. Why will you do this? Because you can set this up with NO payment info, so your kid *cannot* ring up charges no matter what. Anyway, set up the account (or sign into yours), skip the payment info (if it's a new account), and go to the Play Store. * Choose apps and download them. Netflix works. Angry Birds works. Club Penguin works. Etc. (The Disney Channel app doesn't seem to, for some reason, at least for me). Find some apps that don't need Wifi and others that do... you just need a few that don't need it so your kid can use this in the car/while out. Even if you skipped entering payment info, you can download free apps. You can also get a Google Play card and load funds that way... that would let you set a limit on what can be bought but wouldn't force your child to use only free apps. * These apps will show up on your home screen. Move them around as you wish. Again, standard Android stuff you can read about elsewhere. There are millions of apps. I am *sure* you can find a good selection for your kids (and you). You should be good to go. You can now use most Android references to decide what to do next (apps to get, how to change wallpaper, etc.). I recommend downloading Google Play Launcher instead of the default launcher, but that's your call. I also go into Settings and change things like the time until the display sleeps, etc. Again, it's all your call. If you do all this, do you lose the ability to control when and for how long your kid plays? No, not really. Just take the tablet. Or, better, just keep the charger. This won't last long without one. So... why four stars? Yes, it is set up badly - unforgivably badly - out of the box. But most of the issues are resolvable, and it's now a decent, usable, kid-friendly $60 tablet. The silicone bumper is great (note: it'll pick up dirt and stains easily, but, hey, you've got kids, so that's not unusual to you). The fact you can charge it faster with the built-in charger but also can charge via micro USB is very nice... even more so because, if one of those two ports gets broken, you can use the other to charge (pro tip: use electrical tape to block one of them so it's available if the other is jammed with peanut butter). It accepts microSD cards, so you can put movies and such on those and watch with the included UHD Player app or with others, like MX Player (or MX Player Pro, which I prefer). Battery life isn't phenomenal, but it isn't bad for this class of tablet either. Note that this isn't even remotely waterproof, so be careful around fluids. If your kid is especially spill-friendly, you might want to tape up all sorts and untape the charging one only when charging. It's up to you. So, after some work, I actually like this tablet. I have to say that, out of the box, I wasn't fond of it. Now, though, it's quite usable. It just took a little effort. But not too much. It's unfortunate it took any, though.
